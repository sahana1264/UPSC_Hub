GS1,Bonai State,"Bonai State (Odia: ବଣାଇ) was a minor princely state during the British Raj in what is today India. It was one of the Chota Nagpur States and had its capital at Bonaigarh, located in the present-day Sundergarh district of Odisha. It had an area of 8,907 square kilometres (3,439 sq mi), a population of 24,026 in 1892 and an average annual revenue of Rs. 60,000 in 1901.

History
Origins of the Kadamba dynasty of Bonai
As per legend, the founders of the dynasty claimed numerous obscure origins but lack of written archival records dispute them as untenable due to the mythical legends which shrouds the ancestry of the founding clans. Most research into the origins of the dynasty points that the founders of the Bonai State belonged to the head of the Bhuyan clans of the region which was later acquired mythical characteristics.
The founding of the Bonai State led to the establishment of the Kadamba dynasty, named after the flowers of the Kadamba tree (Neolamarckia cadamba) which is also present in the founding legendary myths of the dynasty and also remains the symbol of one of its collateral branch of Athmallik State. The Kadamba tree also plays a central element in the legends of the dominant Bhuyan clans of the region demonstrating the close relationship that the clans play in the royal traditions and rituals of the dynasty. Reconstruction of the court records points that the founder of the dynasty Pratap Bhanu Deo founded the State with the help of local Bhuyan landlords and subjugated the region. The local Bhuyan landlords maintained a strong presence at the royal court, administrative levels and socio-religious traditions of the kingdom.

Modern period
On 1 January 1948 the last ruler of Bonai signed the certificate of accession to the Indian Union after independence and following which it merged with the state of Odisha,Western Odisha, forming a part of the Sundergarh district.Bonai region is mostly habitats by Sambalpuri spiking people.

GS1,Daroga,"Darogas (also spelled darogha or daroghah) were police officials in the Mughal Empire and the British Raj. In the Mughal Empire, a daroga was superintendent of the ""slaves"" of a Mughal monarch.

Caste and duties
Lindsey Harlan identified the darogas with the Ravana Rajputs.
Ramya Sreenivasan stated that the male children born from ""the illegitimate union of Rajputs and their inferiors"" were referred to as daroga and gola, while the female children born from such union were referred to as darogi and goli.

Duties
The darogas served in the armies of Kachhwahas and Mughals; and in accordance with the duties performed by them, the darogas were given various titles like daroga-i-sutarkhana, daroga-i-topkhana, and daroga-i-baroodkhana.
Daroghas answered to district magistrates who were in charge of areas at least 100 square miles (26,000 ha; 64,000 acres); because the magistrates were responsible for such a large area, the daroghas were normally the most powerful local authorities. In some cases, they were in charge of factories. The darogas also had command over the police in rural areas.

Female daroga
The women assigned to the administration of the imperial zenana were also given the title of darogha. The position was appointed by the emperor himself, and marked a great honor for the woman and her family. Consequently, the women given these posts were chosen because they were well brought up, educated and from respectable families. Asmat Banu Begam, the mother of Empress Nur Jahan, had at one time acted in this role. Female daroghas were tasked with maintaining court etiquette and keeping the peace within the zenana.

GS1,Ibn Khordadbeh,"Abu'l-Qasim Ubaydallah ibn Abdallah ibn Khordadbeh (Arabic: ابوالقاسم عبیدالله ابن خرداذبه; 820/825–913), commonly known as Ibn Khordadbeh (also spelled Ibn Khurradadhbih; ابن خرددة), was a high-ranking bureaucrat and geographer of Persian descent in the Abbasid Caliphate. He is the author of the earliest surviving Arabic book of administrative geography.

Biography
Ibn Khordadbeh was the son of Abdallah ibn Khordadbeh, who had governed the northern Iranian region of Tabaristan under the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun (r. 813–833), and in 816/17 conquered the neighbouring region of Daylam, as well as repelled the Bavandid ispahbadh (ruler) Shahriyar I (r. 817–825) from the highlands of Tabaristan. Ibn Khordadbeh's grandfather was Khordadbeh, a former Zoroastrian who was convinced by the Barmakids to convert to Islam. He may have been the same person as Khordadbeh al-Razi, who had provided Abu'l-Hasan al-Mada'ini (died 843) the details regarding the flight of the last Sasanian emperor Yazdegerd III during the Arab conquest of Iran. Ibn Khordadbeh was born in 820 or 825 in the eastern province of Khurasan, but grew up in the city of Baghdad. There he received a cultivated education, and studied music with the prominent singer Ishaq al-Mawsili, a friend of his father. When Ibn Khordadbeh became of age, he was appointed as the caliphal postal and intelligence service in the central province of Jibal, and eventually in Samarra and Baghdad.

Around 870 ibn Khordadbeh wrote Kitāb al Masālik w’al Mamālik (The Book of Roads and Kingdoms) (with the second edition of the book being published in 885).  In this work, ibn Khordadbeh described the various peoples and provinces of the Abbasid Caliphate. Along with maps, the book also includes descriptions of the land, people and culture of the Southern Asiatic coast as far as Brahamputra, the Andaman Islands, peninsular Malaysia and Java.: 108  The lands of Tang China, Unified Silla (Korea) and Japan are referenced within his work.

GS1,Durbar (court),"Durbar is a Persian-derived term (from Persian: دربار, romanized: darbār) referring to the noble court of a king or ruler or a formal meeting where the king held all discussions regarding the state. It was used in South Asia for a ruler's court or feudal levy. A durbar may be either a feudal state council for administering the affairs of a princely state, or a purely ceremonial gathering, as was increasingly the case during British rule in India.
The most famous durbars belonged to powerful emperors and kings. In the north of India, cities like Baroda, Gwalior, Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Agra, and the city of Lahore in Pakistan have palaces and forts that adorn such halls. The Mughal emperor Akbar had two halls—one for his ministers, and the other for the general public. Usually, durbar halls are lavishly decorated with the best possible materials available at the time.
In the south of India, the Mysore Palace had a number of such halls, especially the Peacock Hall, having colour tinted glasses imported from Belgium, which were used for marriage ceremonies. The Durbar Hall in the Khilawat Mubarak, in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, was the Durbar Hall of the Nizams of Hyderabad.
Beneath the main dome of the Rashtrapati Bhavan is the Grand Durbar Hall. As the building now serves as the presidential palace, many state functions are currently carried out there, presided upon by the President of India. The name of Durbar Hall was changed to Gantantra Mandap by Government of India w.e.f. 25.07.2014.

State Council
In the former sense, the native rulers of the Indian subcontinent such as the Marathas and Rajputs, other Hindu or Muslim monarchies, like the Mughals and emirs of Afghanistan, and even Western colonial rulers received visitors in audience, conferred honours, and conducted business in durbar.
A durbar could also be the executive council of a native state. Its membership was dual: the court's grandees, such as the vizier and major jagirdars (feudal l"

GS1,Sanketam,"Sanketam was the name given to temple corporations in medieval Kerala. Land grants given to Brahmins were organized into sanketams, which formed semi-autonomous, self governing bodies. According to M.T. Narayanan, the sanketam was the primary institution through which the Nambudiri Brahmins exerted their influence on the politics of Kerala.
They were the predominant landowning agency of the feudal age, exercising revenue and judicial power. In the region of the sanketam, all temporal authorities were exercised by the temple officials and the local chieftains wielded no control. M.T. Narayanan classifies sanketams as grama sanketams, which formed the original 32 Brahmin settlements of Kerala and kshetra sanketams, which referred to fresh settlements.
Shneider and Gough distinguish four types of temples among the upper castes of Kerala. The first of these were the temples belonging to sanketams, whose estates were managed by Nambudiris. These temples were dedicated to pan-India Hindu deities like Siva or Vishnu. Animal sacrifices were forbidden within the temples of the sanketams and they were restricted to the Brahmin population of the village. The priests of these temples were often lower ranking Nambudiri priests. A few temple-servant castes also used to live in these sanketams.  Second were the private temples owned by Nambudiris which were smaller versions of the first. The third and fourth kinds of temples belonged to royal matrilineal lineages and the ""common"" Nair families and these were often dedicated to Bhagavathi or Bhadrakali.

Governance
The governance of the temple-state was carried out by the body of the yogam, which consisted of the heads (eldest male) of all Brahmin households belonging to the designated region. These members (yogakkar) elected a committee of ooralans (heads of certain Nambudiri households) and a chief, who exercised supreme authority within the confines of the sanketam. The chief (sankethaadhikari) who was usually a kshatriya was ap"

GS1,Shah Quli Khan (governor),"Shah Quli Khan was a 16th-century Mughal official, nawab (governor), and art patron. Shah Quli served as the Mughal nawab of Narnaul, India, and notably constructed a number of historic sites in the state.

Biography
Shah Quli Khan was a member of the governing class of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. As a young man, Shah Quli was a protegee of Bairam Khan, a powerful noble who served as the regent of the Mughal Empire during the early reign of Akbar the Great. Quli's connection to Bairam Khan allowed him to curry an extensive amount of favor with the Mughal court.

Military career
In the 1550s, a series of wars broke out between the Mughals and the Sur Empire. Shah Quli Khan was deployed with the Mughal army during the war, and distinguished himself during the conflicts. During the pivotal Second Battle of Panipat in 1556, Shah Quli fought against and wounded King Hemu.  The battle was a decisive victory for the Mughal empire, and Emperor Akbar commended Shah Quli for his role in the victory, showering him with wealth, titles, and land.

Governor of Narnaul
In the 1570s, Shah Quli Khan was named as the Mughal governor of Narnaul. As governor, Shah Quli began a massive construction program across the territory. His first major project was to construct a tomb in his own honor. The tomb, which has been cited as an excellent example of Mughal architectural style, was built between 1774 and 1775. The tomb featured a planned garden, and was part of Shah Quli's gubernatorial estate.
Fifteen years after building his tomb, Shah Quli Khan began constructing a palace for himself. This building would become known as the Jal Mahal. The palace was built in the middle of an artificial lake, and is adorned with art and carvings. One such carving was done in such a way as to praise Shah Quli Khan's victory over Hemi some forty years earlier.
Upon his death, Shah Quli Khan (who was known for his generosity) donated much of his wealth to his courtiers; it has also been posited"

GS1,Bakhar,"Bakhar is a form of historical narrative written in Marathi prose. Bakhars are one of the earliest genres of medieval Marathi literature. More than 200 bakhars were written in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, the most important of them chronicling the deeds of the Maratha ruler Shivaji. Bakhars are considered valuable resources depicting the Maratha view of history .

Etymology
Most scholars believe that the word bakhar is a metathesis of the Arabic-origin word khabar (""information""). S. N. Joshi argues that the word is derived from the Persian word khair or bakhair (""all is well"", the end salutation in a letter), since it appears at the end of most texts. Bapuji Sankpal argued that the word is derived from the Sanskrit-origin word akhyayika (""story"") or it could be bhyaakh ( bhiyakhya).

Style
The principal characteristics of bakhars are that they were written in prose, had a forceful style of writing, were of political historical nature which appealed to Maratha patriotism, were often commissioned by a patron, displayed an acceptance of tradition and also a belief in the supernatural. Early bakhars were sparsely written and contained a number of words of Persian derivation, later works tended to be voluminous and contained Sanskritised prose.

History
The earliest dates associated with a bakhar are 1448 or 1455, by different authors, being considered as the year that the prose part of ""Mahikavatichi Bakhar"", comprising the second and third chapters, was written by Keshavacharya. The bakhar, which is the compilation of three authors of the 15th and 16th centuries - Bhagwan, Datta and Keshavacharya - is significant as the earliest attempt at uniting the Marathi-speaking populace against oppressive Bahmani rule.
There are around 200 known bakhars, fifty or so of which are considered to be notable, while some others have not been published at all. All the bakhars except for the early works, such as Sabhasad Bakhar, 91 Kalmi Bakhar and the Ajnyapatra Bakhar bes"
GS1,Ceded Districts,"Ceded Districts is the name of an area in the Deccan, India that was 'ceded' to the British East India Company by the Nizam in 1800. The name was in use during the whole period of the British Raj, even though the denomination had no official weight for legal or administrative purposes. The area largely corresponds to the modern region of Rayalaseema.

History
Following the Treaty of Seringapatam the Tippu Sultan accepted to give his northern territory to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1792 AD.
In 1796 AD, the then Nizam Asaf Jah II, harassed by the Marathas and Tipu Sultan, opted to get British military protection under Lord Wellesley's doctrine of Subsidiary Alliance. Now, as a part of this agreement, the Nizam ceded a large portion of the acquired territory to the British, to be added to the Madras Presidency. This area was also known as the Ceded Districts, a term still used for the areas, and included the present day districts of Anantapuram, Kadapa (Cuddapah), much of Karnoolu (Kurnool), Bellary, and parts of Tumkur (Pavagada taluk).
After the defeat and death of Tipu Sultan in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at Battle of Srirangapattana, the Mysooru (Mysore) territories (Map) were divided up between the Wodeyars, the Nizam and the British East India Company.

Together with two younger Britons, the officer Francis Younghusband and the diplomat Harry English Fulford, he explored Manchuria, travelling through the frontier areas of Chinese settlement in the region and to the Changbai Mountains. He published his travel notes, and a solid dose of background information, in a book, The Long White Mountain, or, A journey in Manchuria.... Over a century later, the factual material contained in a work still served as a major source for the historians of the region.

GS1,Kanmer,"Kanmer, locally known as Bakar Kot, is an archaeological site belonging to Indus Valley civilization, located in Rapar Taluk, Kutch District, Gujarat, India.

Excavation
Indo-Japanese joint excavation at Kanmer was undertaken during 2006 by Institute of Rajasthan Studies, RIHN, JRN Rajasthan Vidyapeeth, Archeology Department, Gujarat and Japanese team.

Architecture
The site was strongly fortified despite being small, perhaps because it may have been located on trade route between Sindh and Saurashtra.

Findings
Rich ceramic assemblage, representing the Mature Harappan culture was found at this site. Three clay seals with central holes, making them pendants, with Indus scripts were found. A large number of bead-making goods — 150 stone beads and roughouts, 160 drill bits, 433 faience beads and 20,000 steatite beads — were found here, indicating the site's importance as an industrial unit. Agate quarries were also located at a distance of 20 kilometres (12 mi) from the site.

Importance
The figures appearing on clay seals and their similarity with those of Mohenjo-daro indicate Kanmer's association with bigger trade centres like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.

GS1,Political integration of India,"Before it gained independence in 1947, India (also called the Indian Empire) was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule (British India), and the other consisting of princely states under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with control over their internal affairs remaining to varying degrees in the hands of their hereditary rulers. The latter included 562 princely states which had different types of revenue-sharing arrangements with the British, often depending on their size, population and local conditions. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. After independence, the political integration of these territories into an Indian Union was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Thus, a gradual unification of India was thus followed, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel carried an expansionist movement, where they incorporated numerous princely states through forceful annexations and numerous princely states with diplomacy and negotiations, which resulted in the formation of present day India.
In 1920, Congress (party) under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi declared swaraj (self-rule) for Indians as its goal and asked the princes of India to establish responsible government. Jawaharlal Nehru played a major role in pushing Congress to confront the princely states and declared in 1929 that ""only people who have the right to determine the future of the States must be the people of these States"". In 1937, the Congress won in most parts of British India (not including the princely states) in the provincial elections, and started to intervene in the affairs of the states. In the same year, Gandhi played a major role in proposing a federation involving a union between British India and the princely states, with an Indian central government. In 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru observed that no princely state could prevail militarily a"

GS1,Vatoli communal violence 2008,"Vatoli is a village in Telangana state of India. It was in news when it witnessed communal riots and tension in 2008 when all members of a Muslim family were burned by miscreants. Vatoli was then part of Adilabad district of undivided Andhra Pradesh.
The Vatoli incident evoked strong condemnation from all political parties including the Telugu Desam, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Congress and the BJP. The then Andhra Pradesh government ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident of burning alive of a family but no subsequent corrective development took place later.
Adilabad District Sessions Court judge Aruna Sarika quashed the case against the nine accused arrested in this connection, all members of Hindu Vahini due to lack of proper technical and scientific evidence produced by the Indian investigation agency CB CID.

GS1,Aparanta,"Aparanta, or Aparantaka (meaning ""Western border"") was a geographical region of ancient India. It corresponded to the northern part of the Konkan region on the western coast of India. English civil servant-turned-historian J. F. Fleet believed that the Aparanta region included Kathiawad, Kutch, and Sindh, beside Konkan. However, historical records make it clear that the extent of Aparanta was much smaller.
The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman mentions that during Ashoka's reign, a Yonaraja (literally; Ionian, or Greek, King), Tushaspha was the governor of Aparanta. A Buddhist text, the Mahavamsa states (xii.5) that at the conclusion of the Third Buddhist Council (c.250 BCE), a Yona (Greek) Thera (monk) Dhammarakkhita was sent here by the emperor Ashoka to preach Dhamma and 37,000 people embraced Buddhism due to his effort (Mahavamsa, xii.34-6). Ashoka mentioned the Aparanta in his edict:

te savapāsamdesu viyapatā
dhammādhithanāye chā dhamma-vadhiyā hida-sukhāye vā dhamma-yutasa Yona-Kamboja-Gamdhālānam e vā pi amne apalamtā

—Fifth Major Rock Edict

They have been employed among all sects for the establishment and growth of Dharma and for the good and happiness of those devoted to religion even among the Yonas, Kambojas, Gandharas, Rastrikas, Pitinikas and whatever other peoples of Aparanta or western borders of mine there are.
According to Buddhist scholar A.K. Warder, the Dharmaguptaka sect originated here.
Aparanta is regarded as an umbrella term for Shurparakadesha for Konkan, to include in the North and Gomantaka in the south with the river Kundalika to serving as a dividing line in between the two.

GS1,Jonaraja,"Jonaraja  (died AD 1459) was a Kashmiri historian and Sanskrit poet. His Dvitīyā Rājataraṅginī is a continuation of Kalhana's Rājataraṅginī and brings the chronicle of the kings of Kashmir down to the time of the author's patron Zain-ul-Abidin (r. 1418–1419 and 1420–1470). Jonaraja, however, could not complete the history of the patron as he died in the 35th regnal year. His pupil, Śrīvara continued the history and his work, the Tritīyā Rājataraṅginī, covers the period 1459–1486.
In his Dvitīyā Rājataraṅginī, Jonaraja has vividly described the decline of the Hindu ruling dynasty and the rise of the Muslim ruling dynasty in Kashmir.

It is bounded on the south by Marwar and Jaisalmer regions, on the east by Ajmer-Merwara region.
Bikaner state was a princely state that was founded in the 15th century in this region. After becoming a British protectorate in 1818, it persisted until shortly after India's Independence in 1947.

Prior to the mid 15th century, the region that is now Bikaner was a barren wilderness called Jangladesh. Rao Bika established the city of Bikaner in 1488. He was the son of Rao Jodha of the Rathor Rajput clan, the founder of Jodhpur and conquered the largely arid area in the north of Rajasthan.
Provoked by a stray comment by his father, Bika left Marwar (Jodhpur) with his uncle Kandhmal to create his own kingdom. During his journey, Bika stopped at Deshnok where he consulted the mystic Karni Mata for her blessings and get prophesied that he would be successful. Encouraged by her support, Bika took advantage of the internal rivalries of the Jat people to carve out his own territory in the ""Jangladesh"" region of Rajasthan.
Though it was in the Thar Desert, Bikaner was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (""the settlement of Bika"") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5 km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.
Around a century after Rao Bika founded Bikaner, the state's fortunes flourished under the sixth Raja, Rai Singhji, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the Mughal Empire's rule in the country, Raja Rai Singh accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high rank as an army general at the court of the Emperor Akbar and h"

History
Rao Dynasty rule
Idar State was a princely state that was founded in 1257 by Rao Sonag. Its rulers of all time were Rathore Rajputs. On the question of the succession of the state of Idar, the Sultan of Gujarat, Muzaffar Shah, and  Rana Sanga of Mewar supported rival claimants. In 1520, Sanga established Raimal on the Idar throne, with Muzaffar Shah sending an army to install his ally Bharmal. Sanga himself arrived in Idar and the Sultan's army was beaten back. Rana pursued the Gujarati army and plundered the towns of Ahmadnagar and Visnagar of Gujarat, chasing the Sultan's army as far as Ahmedabad. the Rathore's ruled Idar for 12 generations until they were defeated by the Mughals under Murad Baksh in 1656. Idar then became a part of the Mughal Province of Gujarat.

Marwar Dynasty takeover
In 1729, Anand Singh and Rai Singh, brothers of the Maharaja of Jodhpur, captured Idar by force. They captured the districts of Idar, Ahmednagar, Morasa, Baad, Harsol, Parantij and Vizapur. Five other districts were made tributaries of their new state. The state was soon annexed by the Marathas under Damaji Gaekwad in 1753 and Anand Singh was killed in battle. When Rai Singh got to know about his brother's death he gathered a force and once again captured Idar; he placed Anand Singh's son on the throne and became his guardian. After Rai Singh's death in 1766, the Marathas once again threatened Idar upon which Rao Seo Sinh, son of Anand Singh, agreed to hand over the districts of Parantij and Vizapur to the Peshwa and Morasa, Baad and Harsol to the Gaekwads.
In 1875, Idar state had a revenue of £60,000 and paid a tribute of £3,034 to the Gaekwads of Baroda State. The population of the state in 1875 was 217,382. Th"

GS1,Tristão da Cunha,"Tristão da Cunha (sometimes misspelled Tristão d'Acunha; Portuguese pronunciation: [tɾiʃˈtɐ̃w dɐ ˈkuɲɐ]; c. 1460 – c. 1540) was a Portuguese explorer and naval commander. In 1514, he served as ambassador from King Manuel I of Portugal to Pope Leo X, leading a luxurious embassy presenting in Rome the new conquests of Portugal. He later became a member of the Portuguese privy council.

Italian Wars
Da Cunha was born in Portugal, c. 1460. He served in the Third Italian War under Castilian general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, participating in the Battle of Cerignola and being entasked with hosting the funeral of the fallen French general, Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours. He was also in command of Roca Guillerma, between Gaeta and Salerno, where he was briefly captured by the French army in a betrayal of the local nobility. Da Cunha was later freed. After returning to Portugal, he was nominated as first viceroy of Portuguese India in 1504, but could not take up this post owing to a temporary blindness.

1506 voyage
In 1506 he was appointed commander of a fleet of 15 ships sent to the east coast of Africa and off India. His cousin, Afonso de Albuquerque, was in charge of a squadron of five vessels in this fleet that subsequently detached. Their mission was to conquer Socotra Island and build a fortress there, hoping to close the trade in the Red Sea. They sailed together until they reached Mozambique.  In the Mozambique Channel they found his friend Captain João da Nova stranded while returning from India. They rescued him and the ship Flor de la mar, both joining the fleet. After a series of successful attacks on Arab cities on the east coast of Africa, they headed to Socotra.

Discovery of Tristan da Cunha Archipelago
On this voyage Tristão da Cunha discovered a group of remote islands in the south Atlantic Ocean, 2,816 km (1,750 mi) from South Africa. Although rough seas prevented a landing then, he named the main island after himself, Ilha de Tristão da Cunha, whic"
GS1,History of Bengal,"The history of Bengal is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. It includes modern-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam's Karimganj district, located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, at the apex of the Bay of Bengal and dominated by the fertile Ganges delta. The region was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Gangaridai, a powerful kingdom whose war elephant forces led the withdrawal of Alexander the Great from India. Some historians have identified Gangaridai with other parts of India. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers act as a geographic marker of the region, but also connects the region to the broader Indian subcontinent. Bengal, at times, has played an important role in the history of the Indian subcontinent.
The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas (kingdoms), while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. A thalassocracy and an entrepôt of the historic Silk Road, ancient Bengal had strong trade links with Persia, Arabia and the Mediterranean that focused on its lucrative cotton muslin textiles. The region was a part of several ancient pan-Indian empires, including the Mauryans and Guptas. It was also a bastion of regional kingdoms. The citadel of Gauda served as capital of the Gauda Kingdom, the Buddhist Pala Empire (eighth to 11th century), the Hindu Sena Empire (11th–12th century) and the Hindu Deva Empire (12th-13th century). This era saw the development of Bengali language, script, literature, music, art and architecture.
The Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent absorbed Bengal into the medieval Islamic and Persianate worlds. Between the 1204 and 1352, Bengal was a province of the Delhi Sultanate. This era saw the introduction of the taka as "

GS1,Satara State,"The Satara State was a Maratha rump state in India created after the fall of the Maratha Confederacy in 1818 following the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and annexed by the British in 1849 using the Doctrine of lapse. The state was ruled by the Bhonsle dynasty, descendants of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha kingdom.
The first Raja of the state was Pratap Singh who was installed on the throne by the British after they defeated Peshwa Bajirao II in 1818. Pratap Singh was deposed in 1838. His brother, Shahaji succeeded him but died without a natural heir in 1848. At that time, the East India Company government refused to accept Shahaji's adopted son as his successor under the company's Doctrine of lapse, a policy introduced by the then Governor, 
Lord Dalhousie, and absorbed the territory into the growing British dominion.

Territory
The state comprised the modern day Satara district, and parts of the Pune district, the Sangli district, the Solapur district and the Bijapur district, Karnataka.

GS1,Dunduka,"Dunduka was a king of the state of Kannauj in North India during the early 8th century CE.

Early life
Dunduka was the son and successor of Āma, the king of Kannauj and surrounding areas during the late 8th century CE. Āma, his father, had lost control of Kannauj, and moved to Gopagiri (modern Gwalior). Being under Jain influence, Āma abdicated the throne in favour of Dunduka.

Reign
Dunduka was an immoral and cruel person, who was the ruler of a small and reduced territory. He did not take any interest in his royal duties and neglected his queen Padma. He indulged in debauchery and was pleasure-loving. He is described as ""immoral"" in the Gaudavaho as well. He even made several futile attempts to kill his own son, Bhoja, who was born to Padma. Later, Dunduka was killed by his son Bhoja (not to be confused with Mihira Bhoja), for the throne.
He is considered as an unsuccessful ruler. Āma, his father, he himself, and his son Bhoja are considered as insignificant rulers, who achieved nothing important and reigned for a brief period of 15-20 years. There is no information about Bhoja's successors.

Religion
Dunduka was a follower of Jainism and followed the monk Trivarga.

Wang Dayuan was born around 1311 at Hongzhou (present-day Nanchang).
During 1328–1333, he sailed along the South China Sea and visited many places in Southeast Asia. He reached as far as South Asia and Australia, and landed in modern-day Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India, as well as areas close to modern-day Darwin, Australia. In 1334–1339 he visited North Africa and East Africa.
Around 1330, Wang visited the island of Singapore, where he wrote about a small settlement called Danmaxi (Chinese: 淡马锡; pinyin: Dànmǎxī, Malay: Temasek) that had both Malay and Chinese residents, and already had an established Chinatown. His 1349 account of his travel, Dao Yi Zhi Lue (simplified Chinese: 岛夷志略; traditional Chinese: 島夷誌略; pinyin: Dǎo Yí Zhì Lüè; A Brief Account of Island Barbarians), is one of the few records documenting the early history of Singapore.

In 1349, Wang Dayuan provided the first written account of a visit to Taiwan. He described it as the first overseas kingdom or country「海外諸國，蓋由此始」“Overseas countries start from here”.  He found no Chinese settlers there but many on Penghu.
Wang called different regions of Taiwan Liuqiu and Pisheye. According to Wang, Liuqiu was a vast land of huge trees and mountains named Cuilu, Zhongman, Futou, and Dazhi. A mountain could be seen from Penghu. He climbed the mountain and could see the coasts. Wang described a rich land with fertile fields that was hotter than Penghu. Its people had different customs from Penghu. They did not have boats and oars but only rafts. The men and women bound their hair and wore colored garments.

Indus Valley Civilization Site
Kotla Nihang Khan is also a major archeological site associated with the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, dating to the 3300-1300 BCE period. Several underground structures, including a furnace dating to the Bronze Age, were unearthed here. Kotla Nihang Khan's initial settlement has been dated to 2200 BCE based on analysis of excavated artifacts. The excavated area here shows two distinct sectors: an eastern sector where pottery remains are indicative of Urban Harappan Culture, and a western sector where Urban Harappan artifacts are found mixed with Bara Ware. This is believed to indicate coexistence or a transition between the original Harappan inhabitants and the later Baran settlers at the settlement.

Gurdwara Bhatha Sahib
This place is famous for a historical Gurdwara Bhatha Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of the Sikhs, visited this place in 1688 during their return from Anandpur Sahib and stayed there where there was a brick kilan known as a Bhatha in vernacular Punjabi language. Later, the Gurdwara was built in memory of the visit of the Guru which came to be known as Bhatha Sahib.

There is a fort in the village known as Kotla Nihang Khan Fort which was built by the then Afghan Zimindar ruler Nihang Khan who ruled over 80 villages in the 17 Century.

GS1,Mangarh massacre,"The Mangarh massacre occurred on 17 November 1913, when British and Indian troops attacked the stronghold of Govindgiri Banjara at the end of the Bhil Revolt. It occurred on a hillock in the Mangarh Hills of Rajasthan.  There are no accurate figures for the number of Bhil, Banjara who were killed, but estimates range from ""several Bhils died"" to the oral tradition that 1,500 Banjara tribals were killed.

Background
Govindgiri Banjara was a social and religious reformer among the tribes (adivasi) of the Rajasthan and Gujarat areas of India. He had run afoul of the local princely state rulers, notably Sunth, Banswara, Idar, and Dungarpur because of his critique of the Indian hierarchy and its exploitation of the adivasi, and the subsequent social disruptions by his followers that his doctrines caused.

October–November 1913
Fleeing from an attempt by the ruler of Idar State to capture Govindgiri, Govindgiri Banjara and his adherents formed a defensive position on a hillock in the Mangarh Hills on the borders of the princely states of Banswara and Sunth. On 31 October, some of his followers attacked the police outpost at
Gadhran, looted it, killed one police constable and took another officer captive. On 1 November, some of his followers unsuccessfully attacked the Parbatgadh fort in Sunth. Meanwhile, bands of Bhil from the Mangarh Hills were attacking and looting local villages in both Sunth and Banswara. Police were dispatched from both Banswara and Sunth to end the assembly, but negotiations failed. So the rulers sought a military solution.  Units of Imperial Service Troops and the Mewar Bhil Corps besieged the hillock. On 12 November 1913, Govindgiri and his deputy Punja Pargi (aka Punja Dhirji) sent a delegation to the British with their list of grievances, ""but negotiations did not take place."" However, the commanding officer did give the delegation an ultimatum: Disband before 15 November. The Bhil stood firm and stayed.  On 17 November 1913, the Indian and Brit"

GS1,Zain Khan Sirhindi,"Zain-ud-Din Khan known as Zain Khan Sirhindi (died 14 January 1764) was the Mughal Faujdar of Sirhind, a serviceman of Shah Alam II, and an ally of Najib-ud-Daula and Ahmad Shah Durrani. Zain Khan Sirhindi fought during the Third Battle of Panipat and strengthened Mughal rule in the region.

Biography
Zain Khan was sipahsalar and a great noble at the court of Ahmed Shah Durrani. After the conquest of Delhi by Durrani, he held the subahdarship of Sirhind.
Zain Khan however soon grew notorious for plundering villages within his own territory as well as refusing to pay his own soldiers. Tahmas Khan was disgusted by Zain Khan's actions and he soon left his services and predicted that Zain Khan along with the city of Sirhind would fall.
Zain Khan supported the Durranis and participated in the Vadda Ghallughara genocide of Sikhs that occurred on 5 February 1762.
In January 1764, Ahmad Shah Durrani led his sixth expedition to assist Sadat Yar Khan of Doab and Zain Khan Sirhindi and his Mughal Army which was later overrun outside Sirhind, by 36,000 Sikh rebels led by Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, who plundered Lahore and the upper Doab.

Death
Zain Khan Sirhindi was defeated and killed by the Sikhs in the Battle of Sirhind (1764).

Descendants
Zain Khan was originally from the Khan Khel (family) of Tarakzaī Lalpura Mohmands. His direct descendants are traced in the book ""The Mohmands"" by W. R. H. Merk. Most influential of them are the ones descended from the four sons of Nauroz Khan, who migrated to Peshawar.
Most influential member of the family is Khan Tahir Zaman Khan, who is living in Peshawar and has khani over lalpura.

GS1,Prehistory of Manipur,"The prehistory of Manipur is the period of human history between the first use of stone tools by early men and the time just preceding ancient Kangleipak.

Comparing with other regions of the world, the development process of the archaeological work in Manipur is of recent times. Archaeological research in Northeast India is severely scarce, mostly limited to surface explorations, and lacking in state-of-the-art methods. The pioneering work  in archeology was initiated by O. Kumar Singh. Before his presence, there was little information on the existence of the stone age culture of Manipur.
O. Kumar Singh is of the view that ""Pre-Historic people used to settle in the hills which was habitate by the meiteis and nagas during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic (Hoabinhian) culture while Neolithic people lived in both hills and valley. They came down to the valley at least by about 2000 BC."" On the basis of the characters of the tool industry, the prehistory of Manipur is broadly classified into three periods.

Human settlement
Few attempts have been made to establish the earliest human settlement in Northeast India, and it is generally thought to have been uninhabited by archaic humans prior to late Pleistocene due to unfavorable geographical conditions. This, however, is disputed, and Northeast Corridors are proposed by some scholars to have played a defining role in early hominid migrations and peopling of India.

Paleolithic period
Paleolithic period is the most primitive stone culture era. The Paleolithic period varies from place to place.
In Manipur's neighbouring country Myanmar, the lower Paleolithic culture started from 750000 to 275000 BP. Homo erectus began to settle on the banks of the Ayeyawaddy river in Burma in 750000 BCE. However, in case of Manipur, Paleolithic period started from 20,000 to 10,000 BCE.
Most scholars do not discuss a Paleolithic age in Manipur (and Northeast). However, Manjil Hazarika, in his 2017 survey of prehistory of Northeast India, reje"

It was also known by different names like Odra Desha, Kalinga, Hirakhanda, Mahakantara or Utkala in different eras. Unlike other ancient kingdoms in India, Odisha for most part of the History remained a stable and major power till medieval era due to widespread martial culture and prosperity brought by successive native ruling dynasties.
The year 1568 is considered a turning point in the history of Odisha. In 1568, Kalapahad invaded the state. This, aided by internal conflicts, led to a steady downfall of the state from which it did not recover.

GS1,Pêro da Covilhã,"Pêro da Covilhã (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpeɾu ðɐ kuviˈʎɐ̃]; c. 1460 – after 1526), sometimes written Pero de Covilhã, was a Portuguese diplomat and explorer.
He was a native of Covilhã in Beira. In his early life he had gone to Castile and entered the service of Don Juan de Guzmán, brother of Enrique de Guzmán, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia. Later, when war broke out between Castile and Portugal, he returned to his own country, and attached himself, first as a groom, then as a squire, to Afonso V of Portugal and his successor John II of Portugal.  In 1487, his overland expedition made its way to India, exploring trade opportunities with the Indians and Arabs, and winding up finally in Ethiopia. His detailed report was eagerly read in Lisbon, as Portugal became the world's  best informed center for global geography and trade routes.

Mission to the East
Covilhã was an adventurer of low birth but an adept swordsman and loyal servant to the Portuguese Crown. His fluency in Arabic and Castilian allowed him to perform undercover operations in Spain as well as undertaking secret negotiations in Morocco on behalf of King John II of Portugal. These successful exploits prodded the King to send  him and Afonso de Paiva to undertake a mission of exploration in the Near East and the adjoining regions of Asia and Africa, with the special assignment to learn where cinnamon and other spices could be found, as well as of discovering the land of legendary Prester John, by overland routes. Bartolomeu Dias, at the same time, went out to by sea find the Prester's country, as well as the termination of the African continent and the ocean route to India.
The expedition started at Santarém, on May 7, 1487. Covilhã and Paiva were briefed by the Bishop of Tangiers and two Jewish mathematicians, Rodrigo and Moisés, who were prominent members of the commission which advised the Portuguese government to reject the proposals of Christopher Columbus.

GS1,Battle of Patti,"The Battle of Patti was fought in March 1754 between three Sikhs and Mughal forces led by Alim Beg Khan. The battle location was fought in the city of Patti.

Background

His brothers fought against the Sikhs in which 300 soldiers of his were killed. Upon learning this, Qasim marched to the battlefield.

Battle
Qasim was accompanied by 2 horsemen that joined him. He saw that his men were chasing 10,000 sikhs. After proceeding further, he was amazed and surprised to see just 5 mughal horsemen driving away the sikh forces. He followed the three Sikhs finding a large number of dead bodies. Qasim Khan was rushed to safety by a tribesmen.

Aftermath
After a few days, Qasim marched back. He recruited 8,000 Sikhs soldiers with friendly negotiations and planned to seize Lahore with them.

GS1,Battle of Sirhind (1555),"The Battle of Sirhind was fought between the Mughal Empire and the Sur Empire in 1555.

Background
Humayun had been in exile for 15 years after being forced to flee by Sher Shah Suri, a Pashtun commander who had taken control of the Mughal territories. During his exile, Humayun spent time in Persia where he was exposed to Persian high culture and military technology. This exposure gave him valuable insight into administration, politics, and warfare, which would later serve him well in his quest to reclaim his empire. After defeating his brothers in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, Humayun was able to solidify his hold over the region and return to India, where he successfully recaptured Babur's former capital of Delhi and reestablished the Mughal Empire.
After the death of Islam Shah Suri, the Suri Empire had erupted in a civil war where various contenders to the throne fought each other for supremacy.  Sikandar Shah Suri was occupied with his struggle against Ibrahim Shah Suri when Humayun mobilized an army from Kabul.  He captured Rohtas Fort and Lahore in February 1555. Another detachment of his forces captured Dipalpur, Gurdaspur and Jalandhar. Their advanced division proceeded towards Sirhind. Sikandar sent a force of 30,000 to intercept them but they were defeated by the Mughal Army in the Battle of Machhiwara and Sirhind was occupied by the Mughals.

Battle
Sikandar led an army of 90,000 and met the Mughals at Sirhind. On 22 June 1555 they met in battle. Humayun and Bairam Khan carried out a daring raid in a rainstorm like Sher Shah Suri had done at the Battle of Chausa to defeat Humayun. Sikander was defeated by the Mughal Army and was compelled to retreat to the Sivalik Hills in northeastern Punjab. The victorious Mughals marched to Delhi, occupied it and reestablished their empire in India.

GS1,Looking East to Look West,"Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yew's Mission India won India's most prestigious literary non-fiction prize, the Vodafone Crossword Book Award for 2009. Written by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, the book is a ""profound"" and ""intricate"" analytic-history of India's first major foreign policy innovation since Non-alignment: the Look East policy. The policy began, according to Datta-Ray, during P.V. Narasimha Rao's tenure as Prime Minister of India. Rao devised the policy as only the first stage of a strategy to foster economic and security cooperation with the United States. However Looking East became an end in itself, and Singapore a valid destination, largely because of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. Today, Singapore is the route for the bulk of foreign direct investment into India and the channel for Indian companies to export to the international market. Datta-Ray details how this came about on the basis of eight one-on-one conversations with Lee, a series of interviews with supporting actors and a host of, till now, unseen documents, spanning peoples and historical records over nearly 75 years.

Editions
Published for the Indian market by Penguin, there have been three reprints of the international edition which is published by the Institute of South East Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore. Datta-Ray is alleged to have said at the Vodafone Crossword award ceremony that the international edition is better produced than the Indian edition (see below).

Reception
Before the award, the book was well received in both India and Singapore. Recognizing that the title was understated because the book contained a novel argument which drew upon complex source material, the Indian Express said: ""For once, a book delivers more than what the cover promises."" Amitabh Mattoo, a leading Indian scholar, writes the book is, ""a masterly chronicle"". Singapore's The Straits Times carried fulsome reviews of the book.

The foremost among these sources is the Sangam literature, generally dated to 5th century BCE to 3rd century CE. The poems in Sangam literature contain vivid descriptions of the different aspects of life and society in Tamilakam during this age; scholars agree that, for the most part, these are reliable accounts. Greek and Roman literature, around the dawn of the Christian era, give details of the maritime trade between Tamilakam and the Roman Empire, including the names and locations of many ports on both coasts of the Tamil country.
Archaeological excavations of several sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as different kinds of pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.
Inscriptions found on caves and pottery are another source for studying the history of Tamilakam. Writings in Tamil-Brahmi script have been found in many locations in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and also in Egypt and Thailand. mostly recording grants made by the kings and chieftains. References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow and arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.

GS1,Jami' al-tawarikh,"Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh (lit. 'The Compendium of Chronicles') is a work of literature and history, produced in the Mongol Ilkhanate. Written by Rashid al-Din Hamadani (1247–1318 AD) at the start of the 14th century, the breadth of coverage of the work has caused it to be called ""the first world history"". It was in three volumes and published in Arabic and Persian versions.
The surviving portions total approximately 400 pages of the original work. The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.
The lavish illustrations and calligraphy required the efforts of hundreds of scribes and artists, with the intent that two new copies (one in Persian, and one in Arabic) would be created each year and distributed to schools and cities around the Ilkhanate, in the Middle East, Central Asia, Anatolia, and the Indian subcontinent. Approximately 20 illustrated copies were made of the work during Rashid al-Din's lifetime, but only a few portions remain, and the complete text has not survived. The oldest known copy is an Arabic version, of which half has been lost, but one set of pages is currently in the Khalili Collection of Islamic Art (London, England), comprising 59 folios from the second volume of the work. Another set of pages, with 151 folios from the same volume, is owned by the Edinburgh University Library. Two Persian copies from the first generation of manuscripts survive in the Topkapı Palace Library in Istanbul. The early illustrated manuscripts together represent ""one of the most important surviving examples of Ilkhanid art in any medium"", and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the Persian miniature.

In 1854, Chhatarpur would have lapsed to the British government for want of direct heirs under the doctrine of lapse, but was conferred on Jagat Raj as a special act of grace.  The Rajas ruled a princely state with an area of 1,118 square miles (2,900 km2), and population of 156,139 in 1901, which was part of the Bundelkhand agency of Central India.
In 1901 the town of Chhatarpur had a population of 10,029, a high school and manufactured paper and coarse cutlery.  The state also contained the British cantonment of Nowgaon.
After the independence of India in 1947, the Rajas of Chhatarpur acceded to India, and Chhatarpur, together with the rest of Bundelkhand Agency, became part of the Indian state of Vindhya Pradesh.  Vindhya Pradesh was merged into the state of Madhya Pradesh in 1956.

GS1,Patkum estate,"Patkum estate (also romanised as Patkam, Patkom and Patcoom in early record) was one of the zamindari estates of India during the period of the British Raj. It is believed that the estate was found by scion of the King Vikramaditya of Solar dynasty. During British raj it was part of Bengal presidency, composing today's Chandil, Kukru, Nimdih, Ichagarh and Kandra. Ichagarh was the capital of the state.

Etymology
The name Patkum derived from dialect of aboriginal people. The capital of the estate Ichagarh derived from icha means wish and garh. The capital named after wish of queen.

History
The Patkum zamindari estate was initially part of the extensive Ramgarh district until the late 18th century. Subsequently, it became a part of the Birbhum district until 1805 when it was integrated into the Jungle Mahals. Later, it transitioned to Panchet and then to the Manbhum district of British India. After India gained independence, the region came under the jurisdiction of Bihar province. However, due to the 1953 State Reorganization, the Patkum territory underwent a partition, with some areas being allocated to Bihar (present-day Jharkhand) and others to West Bengal states.

GS1,Kingdom of Kherla,"The Kherla Kingdom was the earliest kingdom in the Indian region of Gondwana, regarded as one of the four ancient Gond kingdoms. Narsingh Rai was the first king of this dynasty and one of the earliest known Gond rulers. A Rajput dynasty is said to have preceded the Gond rule at Kherla. It was constantly caught between the conflicts of the North Indian Muslim rulers like the rulers of Mandu and the Deccan sultanates. Sources regarding this kingdom are notable nonexistent, unlike the other Gond rulers.

History
A Rajput dynasty was ruling in Kherla before the Gonds. The greatest of those Rajput rulers was named Jaitpal, who is credited with building the fortress of Kherla. Jaitpal was succeeded by Narsingh Rai, the first Gond ruler of Kherla. During his reign, the kingdom stretched in a westerly direction to the hills north of Berar, including the fortress of Gawilghur. His reign was marked by constant warfare with the Muslim rulers to his north and south.

GS1,Pottery in the Indian subcontinent,"Pottery in the Indian subcontinent has an ancient history and is one of the most tangible and iconic elements of Indian art. Evidence of pottery has been found in the early settlements of Lahuradewa and later the Indus Valley Civilisation. Today, it is a cultural art that is still practiced extensively in the subcontinent. Until recent times all Indian pottery has been earthenware, including terracotta.
Early glazed ceramics were used for making beads, seals, bangles during Neolithic period but these glazes were very rarely used on pottery. Hindu traditions historically discouraged the use of pottery for eating off, while large matki jars for the storage of water or other things form the largest part of traditional Indian pottery, as well as objects such as lamps.  Small simple kulhar cups, and also oil lamps, that are disposable after a single use remain common. Today, pottery thrives as an art form in India. Various platforms, including potters' markets and online pottery boutiques have contributed to this trend.
This article covers pottery vessels, mainly from the ancient Indian cultures known from archaeology.  There has also been much figurative sculpture and decorative tilework and roof tiles in ceramics in the subcontinent, with the production of terracotta figurines being widespread in different regions and periods.  In Bengal in particular, a lack of stone produced an extensive tradition of architectural sculpture for temples and mosques in terracotta and carved brick. The approximately life-size figures decorating gopurams in South India are usually painted terracotta. Traditional pottery in the subcontinent is usually made by specialized kumhar (Sanskrit: kumbhakära) potter communities.
In 2018, the value of ceramics of all types produced in the Republic of India was projected to reach €7.5 billion in 2022. In 2022, annual production of ceramic tableware in India was estimated to be 40,000 tonnes.

GS1,Sven Hedin,"Sven Anders Hedin, KNO1kl RVO, (19 February 1865 – 26 November 1952) was a Swedish geographer, topographer, explorer, photographer, travel writer and illustrator of his own works. During four expeditions to Central Asia, he made the Transhimalaya known in the West and located sources of the Brahmaputra, Indus and Sutlej Rivers. He also mapped lake Lop Nur, and the remains of cities, grave sites and the Great Wall of China in the deserts of the Tarim Basin. In his book Från pol till pol (From Pole to Pole), Hedin describes a journey through Asia and Europe between the late 1880s and the early 1900s. While traveling, Hedin visited Turkey, the Caucasus, Tehran, Iraq, lands of the Kyrgyz people and the Russian Far East, India, China and Japan. The posthumous publication of his Central Asia Atlas marked the conclusion of his life's work.

Overview
At 15 years of age, Hedin witnessed the triumphal return of the Arctic explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld after his first navigation of the Northern Sea Route. From that moment on, young Sven aspired to become an explorer. His studies under the German geographer and China expert, Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen, awakened a love of Germany in Hedin and strengthened his resolve to undertake expeditions to Central Asia to explore the last uncharted areas of Asia.  After obtaining a doctorate, learning several languages and dialects, and undertaking two trips through Persia, he ignored the advice of Ferdinand von Richthofen to continue his geographic studies to acquaint himself with geographical research methodology; the result was that Hedin had to leave the evaluation of his expedition results later to other scientists.
Between 1894 and 1908, in three daring expeditions through the mountains and deserts of Central Asia, he mapped and researched parts of Chinese Turkestan (now Xinjiang) and Tibet which had been unexplored by Europeans until then. Upon his return to Stockholm in 1909 he was received as triumphantly as Adolf Erik No"

GS1,Gaspar Correia,"Gaspar Correia (1492 – c. 1563 in Goa) was a Portuguese historian considered a Portuguese Polybius.  He authored Lendas da Índia (Legends of India), one of the earliest and most important works about Portuguese rule in Asia.

Biography
Little is known of the author or his family origins and birthplace. It is assumed that he was born in 1492. He lived mostly in Portuguese India, reportedly arriving around 1512-14 to serve as a soldier and then chosen as scrivener to Afonso de Albuquerque, for which he was very proud. He returned to Portugal in 1529 for some time but later returned to India. His work Lendas da Índia, though written in a rude style, is considered an indispensable contemporary reference, having profited from his thirty-five years' work in India, and from privileged sources unknown to Fernão Lopes de Castanheda or João de Barros. He wrote the first European account on Asiatic Cholera. One theory suggests that he was murdered in Portuguese Malacca, by order of Governor Estêvão da Gama, the son of Vasco da Gama.
The 3,500-page Lendas da Índia manuscript was brought from India to Portugal by Miguel da Gama shortly after Correia's death and copies circulated only among authorised persons.  One author claims, without citing any source, that the manuscript was published in 12 volumes in 1556 but, if it existed, no trace remains. His family retained the manuscript of the original, which was printed in 1858 (first part) and 1864 (second part) by the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon.
He died around 1563 in Goa, Portuguese India.

After the Independence of India, Jashpur State was merged with the princely states of Raigarh, Sakti, Sarangarh and Udaipur to form the Raigarh district of Madhya Pradesh. Now the district of Raigarh is part of Chhattisgarh state.

History
The area of Jashpur State was ruled by a Dom dynasty at the time of the Mughal Empire. Sujan Rai, a son of the Suryavanshi Raja of Banswada in Rajputana, arrived to the place and saw that the population was not satisfied with their ruler, Raibhan Dom. Sujan led a rebellion, defeated and killed the Dom Raja in battle, and proclaimed himself king.
The Chauhan Rajput rajas of Jashpur accepted the sovereignty of the Bhonsle dynasty of Nagpur State, paying a tribute of 21 buffalos. Before 1818 the Bhonsle placed Jashpur State under the administration of Surguja State. The state became a British protectorate in 1818.
Jashpur was one of the states of the Eastern States Agency. The last ruler of this princely state signed the accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1948.

GS1,Charter Act 1793,"The East India Company Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 52), also known as the Charter Act 1793, was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain which renewed the Charter issued to the British East India Company (EIC). The veto which was originally given to Lord Cornwallis  was continued for all the Governor-Generals.
Bombay and Madras presidency were kept under superintendence of Fort William.

Provisions
In contrast with legislation concerning British India proposed in the preceding two decades, the 1793 Act ""passed with minimal trouble"".  The Act made only fairly minimal changes to either the system of government in India or British oversight of the company's activities.  Most importantly, the company's trade monopoly was continued for a further 20 years.  Salaries for the staff and paid members of the Board of Control were also now charged to the company.  Other provisions of the Act included:

The Governor-General was granted extensive powers over the subordinate presidencies of Madras and Bombay.
The Governor-General's power of over-ruling his council was affirmed.
Royal approval was mandated for the appointment of the Governor-General, the governors, and the Commander-in-Chief.
This Act continued the company's rule over the British territories in India.
It continued the company's trade monopoly in India for another 20 years.
The Act established that “acquisition of sovereignty by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own *right,” which clearly stated that the company's political functions were on behalf of the British government.
The company's dividends were allowed to be raised to 10%.
The Governor-General was given more powers.
When the Governor-General was present in Madras or Bombay, he would supersede in authority over the governors of Madras and Bombay.
In the Governor-General's absence from Bengal, he could appoint a vice president from among the civilian members of his Council.

GS1,Flag of Sikkim,"At present there is no official flag of Sikkim, a state in India. The independent Kingdom of Sikkim did have a national flag until it became a state of India in 1975.

Prior to 1877
before 1877, during the Nepalese-Bhutanese suzerainty and as a protectorate of Tibet, several Nepalese, Bhutanese and Tibetan banners were flown in Sikkim until 1816, when the United Kingdom took control of the country and flown the Union Jack until 1877, when the first Sikkimese flag was adopted.

Kingdom of Sikkim (1877–1975)
The Kingdom of Sikkim had used several flags during its history. They all contained a Buddhist khorlo prayer wheel with the gankyil as the central element.
Until 1967, the previous flag showed a very complex design with a fanciful border and religious pictograms surrounding the khorlo.
A more simple design was adopted in 1967 because of the difficulty in duplication of the complex flag. The border became solid red, the pictograms were removed and the wheel was redesigned.
With the admission of Sikkim to the Republic of India and with the abolition of the monarchy, the flag lost its official status in 1975.

State of India (1975–present)
The Government of Sikkim can be represented by a banner that depicts the emblem of the state on a white background.

GS1,Al-Biruni,"Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni  (Persian: ابوریحان بیرونی; Arabic: أبو الريحان البيروني; 973 – after 1050), known as al-Biruni, was a Khwarazmian Iranian scholar and polymath during the Islamic Golden Age. He has been called variously ""Father of Comparative Religion"", ""Father of modern geodesy"", Founder of Indology and the first anthropologist.
Al-Biruni was well versed in physics, mathematics, astronomy, and natural sciences, and also distinguished himself as a historian, chronologist, and linguist. He studied almost all the sciences of his day and was rewarded abundantly for his tireless research in many fields of knowledge. Royalty and other powerful elements in society funded al-Biruni's research and sought him out with specific projects in mind. Influential in his own right, al-Biruni was himself influenced by the scholars of other nations, such as the Greeks, from whom he took inspiration when he turned to the study of philosophy. A gifted linguist, he was conversant in Khwarezmian, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, and also knew Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac. He spent much of his life in Ghazni, then capital of the Ghaznavids, in modern-day central-eastern Afghanistan. In 1017, he travelled to the Indian subcontinent and wrote a treatise on Indian culture entitled Tārīkh al-Hind (""The History of India""), after exploring the Hindu faith practiced in India. He was, for his time, an admirably impartial writer on the customs and creeds of various nations, his scholarly objectivity earning him the title al-Ustadh (""The Master"") in recognition of his remarkable description of early 11th-century India.

Name
Al-Biruni's name is derived from the Persian word bērūn or bīrūn (""outskirts""), as he was born in an outlying district of Kath, the capital of the  Afrighid kingdom of Khwarazm. The city, now called Beruniy, is part of the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan in northwest Uzbekistan.

GS1,List of colonial governors and presidents of Madras Presidency,"This is a list of the governors, agents, and presidents of colonial Madras, initially of the English East India Company, up to the end of British colonial rule in 1947.

English Agents
In 1639, the grant of Madras to the English was finalized between the factors of the Masulipatnam (now Machilipatnam) factory (trading post), represented by Francis Day, and the Raja of Chandragiri. In 1640, Andrew Cogan, the chief of the Masulipatnam factory, made his way to Madras in the company of Francis Day and the English and Indian employees of the Masulipatnam factory. The Agency of Madras was established on 1 March 1640 and Cogan was made the first Agent. The official title was 'Governor of Fort St George' and the Governor was usually referred to as Agent. Cogan served in the post for three years and was succeeded by Francis Day. After four agents had served their terms, Madras was upgraded to a Presidency during the time of Aaron Baker. However financial considerations forced the company to revert to an agency soon after Aaron Baker had served his term. The Agency survived until 1684 when Madras was made a Presidency once and for all. Streynsham Master is the best remembered and most renowned of the Agents of Madras.

Presidents
Madras was elevated to a presidency in 1684 and remained so until 12 February 1785 when new rules and regulations brought by the Pitt's India Act reformed the administration of the East India Company with the exception of a three-year period of French rule from 1746 to 1749 when Madras was a governorship.
Subsequently, Elihu Yale who took charge on 8 August 1684 was the First President of Madras. Elihu Yale, Thomas Pitt and George Macartney are some of the well-known Presidents of Madras.

Governors of the French East India Company

Although originally the slogan was used by Indian independence movement activists in British India, today it is used in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan by civil society activists during protests as well as by politicians from various ideological backgrounds.

History
This slogan was coined by the Islamic scholar, Urdu poet, Indian freedom fighter, prominent leader of Indian National Congress and one of the founders of communist party of India, Maulana Hasrat Mohani in 1921.
It was popularized by Bhagat Singh (1907–1931) during the late 1920s through his speeches and writings. It was also the official slogan of the 
Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, and the slogan of Communist Consolidation as well as a slogan of the All India Azad Muslim Conference.
In April 1929, this slogan was raised by Bhagat Singh and his associate Batukeshwar Dutt who had shouted this after bombing the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi.
Later, for the first time in an open court, this slogan was raised in June 1929 as part of their joint statement at the High Court in Delhi.
Since then, it became one of the rallying cries of the Indian independence movement, with which the phrase has been most identified. In Indian political novels chronicling the independence movement, a pro-independence sentiment is often characterized by characters shouting this slogan.
This slogan also became widely popular during the July Revolution in Bangladesh.

GS1,Indian Feudalism (book),"Indian Feudalism is a book by Indian professor Ram Sharan Sharma. The book analyses the practice of land grants, which became considerable in the Gupta period and widespread in the post-Gupta period. It shows how this led to the emergence of a class of landlords, endowed with fiscal and administrative rights superimposed upon a class of peasantry which was deprived of communal agrarian rights.
Professor Sharma studies in detail the basic relationships in early medieval society down to the eve of the Ghorian conquests. He argues in favour of a ""feudalism largely realising the surplus from peasants mainly in kind through superior rights in their land and through forced labour, which is not found on any considerable scale... after the Turkish conquest of India.""
The third revised edition of the book was published by Macmillan Publishers in 2005.

GS1,Battle of Gurung Hill,"The Battle of Gurung Hill was a significant engagement during the Sino-Indian War of 1962, fought in the strategically important region of Ladakh, India. Indian forces, facing a massive Chinese offensive, successfully defended Gurung Hill after intense fighting in November 1962.

Background
The Sino-Indian War broke out in 1962 over disputed border regions between India and China. Ladakh, with its high-altitude terrain and strategic locations, became a key battleground. The Chinese launched a series of attacks across the front, aiming to seize Indian positions in the region. Gurung Hill, located near the Spanggur Gap in Ladakh, was a vital position for both sides, offering a commanding view of the surrounding area and control over approaches into southern Ladakh. It became the target of heavy Chinese assaults during the conflict.

The Battle
In November 1962, Chinese forces launched a determined attack on Gurung Hill. Indian forces, heavily outnumbered and lacking artillery support, faced overwhelming odds. However, the Indian Army employed innovative tactics to bolster their defenses, including the use of tanks airlifted into the Ladakh region, which played a critical role in the battle. The Indian Air Force carried out one of the most extraordinary operations of the war by airlifting AMX-13 tanks to the Ladakh front. These tanks helped solidify Indian positions at Gurung Hill and contributed to repelling Chinese forces. The Chinese launched several waves of attacks but faced stiff resistance from the Indian defenders. In the face of fierce hand-to-hand combat and heavy casualties, Chinese forces were unable to capture the hill.

Aftermath
Despite the Chinese numerical advantage, Indian forces managed to hold Gurung Hill. The successful defense marked a significant victory for India during the war, showcasing the bravery and tenacity of the Indian soldiers. The battle had wider strategic implications, helping to stabilize the defense in the region.

GS1,Prataprao Gujar,"Prataprao Gujar (also Kudtoji Gujar, Marathi pronunciation: [pɾət̪aːpɾaːʋ ɡud͡ʒəɾ]; c. 1615 – 24 February 1674) was a Maratha general who served as the 3rd Senapati of the Maratha Empire during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji. He commanded the Maratha Army until 1674.

Military career
Prataprao Gujar raided Khandesh in 1670 and captured some forts from the Mughals in Baglan. He plundered Bahadurpur and, riding into Berar, looted the city of Karanja. From this time, Shivaji began levying chauth from the Mughal territories through which he passed.

Victory at Salher
At the Battle of Salher, Prataprao Gujar routed a sizable Mughal army. The Maratha victory at Salher is seen as a watershed in their military campaigns against the formidable Mughal army.

Confrontation with the Adil Shahis
Prataprao Gujar was later dispatched to confront the Adil Shah's invading army under the command of Bahlol Khan. During the battle, Bahlol Khan was besieged by the Maratha army and taken as a prisoner. However, upon Khan's promise not to invade Maratha territory again, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan (around 15 April 1673). 
However, Bahalol Khan returned again with a larger army which enraged Prataprao Gujar and he decided to attack Bahalol Khan on 24 February 1674. According to the description given by Krishnaji Ananta and the letter of the English interpreter Narayan Shenvi, dated 4 April 1674, ""Prataprao attacked Bahalol Khan's camp in Nesari with only six of his trusted battle-hardened commanders. It was a daring surgical strike which killed many in the enemy camp and demoralised the Bahlol's army. During this daring raid, Prataprao and his six lieutenants also got martyred but only after inflicting huge damage to the enemy camp"".

Popular culture

GS1,Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen,"Tuhfat al-Mujahidin fi ba‘d Akhbar al-Burtughaliyin (Arabic:تحفة المجاهدين في بعض اخبار البرتغاليين, often shortened as Tuhfat al-Mujahidin) is a historical work by Zainuddin Makhdoom II on the struggle between the Mappila Muslims of Malabar and South Canara and Portuguese colonial forces in the 16th century. The book describes the resistance put up by the navy of Kunjali Marakkar alongside the Zamorin of Calicut from 1498 to 1583 against Portuguese attempts to colonize the Malabar coast. Along with chronological events of the era, the book also provides an analysis of the events, as well as the lifestyle, customs and family structure of the people of the time.

Summary
Shaikh Zainuddin Makhdum, born in 1517 AD, was a historian, and a religious scholar from Ponnani. Completed in 1583, his work Tuhfat is one of the few Asian sources that narrate the reaction of the Muslim populations of the Malabar coast to the Portuguese colonial expansion into the south west of India. It is also important as a pioneering work about the origins of the Mappila community in modern-day Kerala and has been reviewed as ""a study in liberation theology of Islam"". The work was translated into many European languages, notable among which are História dos Portugueses no Malabar, by David Lopes  in 1898 and the English translation by S. Muhammad Husayn Nainar, titled Tuhfat al-Mujāhidīn: A Historical Epic of the Sixteenth Century published in 1942 by the University of Madras. Another translation into Malayalam was written by C. Hamza, in 1995.
This is called by many as a source book of struggle against European colonial history. It details the history of Kerala, on the arrival of Islam in Kerala through Malik ibn Dinar. It expounds the extent of good relations between the Zamorins of Calicut and between the Muslims. It traces the socio-cultural decay of the Muslim community and the consequential Portuguese piracy and occupation in Malabar. It prays for the prosperity of the Zamorins and exhort"
GS1,Hendrik van Rheede,"Hendrik Adriaan van Rheede tot Drakenstein (13 April 1636 – 15 December 1691) was a Dutch military man and colonial administrator of the Dutch East India Company.  Between 1669 and 1676 he served as a governor of Dutch Malabar at Kochi and employed twenty-five people on his book Hortus Malabaricus, describing 740 plants in the region. As Lord of Mydrecht, he also played a role in the governance of the Cape colonies. Many plants such as the vine Entada rheedii are named for him. The standard author abbreviation Rheede is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.

Biography
Van Rheede was born into a family of noblemen that played a leading role in the political, administrative and cultural life of the province of Utrecht. His mother, Elisabeth van Utenhove, died in 1637 while his father, Ernst van Rheede, Council at the Admiralty of Amsterdam, died when he was four. Hendrik Adriaan, the youngest of seven children, left home at the age of fourteen. In 1656 he joined as a soldier in the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C., Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) and served alongside Johan Bax van Herenthals (who would also take an interest in natural history). Van Rheede served under Admiral Rijcklof van Goens in campaigns against the Portuguese on the west coast of India in erstwhile Dutch Malabar. He gained rapid promotion becoming an ensign.  In 1663, during a siege of Cochin, he was ordered to arrest the old queen of Cochin Rani Gangadhara Lakshmi to keep her safe, and this act saved her life from the massacre of the royal family. The subsequent king of Cochin, Vir Kerala Verma was crowned by the VOC and Van Rheede was appointed as the 'regedore maior' or the first councillor of the kingdom of Cochin. Van Rheede  maintained cordial relations with the king and helped him in administration as well as mediation with the other kingdoms of Malabar. During the next two years, van Rheede traveled extensively in Malabar on behalf of VOC to get trade "
GS1,Maratha Confederacy,"The Maratha Confederacy, also referred to as the Maratha Empire, was an early modern polity in the Indian subcontinent. It comprised the realms of the Peshwa and four major independent Maratha states often subordinate to the former. It was established in 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as the Maratha Chhatrapati and recognised by Emperor Bahadur Shah I as a tributary state in 1707 following a prolonged rebellion. Following this, the Marathas continued to recognise the Mughal emperor as their nominal suzerain, similar to other contemporary Indian entities, though in practice, imperial politics at Delhi were largely controlled by the Marathas between 1737 and 1803.
Although Shivaji came from the Maratha community, the Maratha government also included warriors, administrators, and other nobles from the Maratha and several other Marathi groups from what is known today as Maharashtra. Shivaji's monarchy was initially referred to as the Maratha Kingdom, which expanded into a large realm in the 18th century under the leadership of Peshwa Bajirao I. The Marathas were a Marathi-speaking peasantry group from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra) who rose to prominence by establishing Hindavi Swarajya (meaning ""self-rule of Indians"").
The Marathas became prominent in the politics of the Indian subcontinent during the seventeenth century under the leadership of Shivaji, who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughals to carve out a kingdom with Raigad as his capital. The religious attitude of Emperor Aurangzeb estranged non-Muslims, and the Maratha insurgency came at a great cost for his men and treasury and eventually ensured Maratha ascendency and their control over sizeable portions of former Mughal dominions in the north of the Indian subcontinent.
After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, Shivaji's grandson Shahu under the leadership of Peshwa Bajirao revived Maratha power and confided a great deal of authority to the Bhat family, who became hereditar"

GS1,Battle of Kannanur,"The Battle of Kannanur took place in 1342–43, in what is now Kannanur, Tamil Nadu, India. This clash involved the Hoysala dynasty and the Madurai Sultanate. King Ballala III of the Hoysalas led an expedition to conquer the Coromandal coast but faced opposition from the Madurai Sultan, Ghiyas-ud-din Muhammad Damghani.
Initially, the Hoysala forces triumphed in the first encounter. However, they were defeated by the Sultan's forces during the subsequent siege of the Kannanur fort, where they were defeated by the determined Madurai forces. The retreat of the Hoysalas led to the capture and execution of Ballala III and the seizure of the Hoysala treasury by the Madurai Sultan. This significant event marked a turning point, resulting in the decline of Hoysala power in the region, leaving a lasting impact on the area's history.

Background
Veera Ballala III, the King of the Hoysala dynasty, found himself embroiled in conflicts with the Delhi Sultanate, resulting in the loss of his territories. In 1340, Ghiyasuddin Damghani assumed the throne of the Madurai Sultanate. The Madurai Sultanate had initially been a part of the Delhi Sultanate but gained independence during the rule of Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan in 1335.
Kannanur held significant historical importance as a city within the Hoysala dynasty, having even served as its capital at certain times. However, the Hoysalas eventually lost control of Kannanur to the Delhi Sultanate, and subsequently, it became a part of the Madurai Sultanate's territory.

Initial conflict
In 1342, Ballala III embarked on a campaign to capture the Coromandel coast from the Madurai Sultanate. The Hoysala forces, comprising 100,000 soldiers, encountered opposition from Ghiyasuddin's Madurai forces near Kannanur. After an initial defeat, the Madurai forces, numbering 6,000 men, were compelled to retreat towards Madurai.

Final conflict
The Hoysala forces initiated a march towards the Kannanur fort with the intent to besiege and capture it. Ballala le"

GS1,Dasharupakam,"Dasharupakam (Daśarūpakam) is a treatise on the structure and rules (Lakshana or Prakarana grantha) for popular theatre and drama presentations of the time, written by Dhananjaya in the 10th century. He was the court poet of Paramara king Munja. Several techniques and methods presented in the Natya Shastra and Dasharupakam are very much in use in today's theatre. The author starts with salutations, among others, to  Bharata  the author of Natya Shastra, whose detailed exposition he bases his work on. He however in his own words says that he has attempted to present the same in an ordered and concise fashion in his book, so it can be consumed by common folk. Rupakam means one that has a form and can be seen - essentially referring to theatre and drama performances. He uses the same word used by Bharata to refer to his work, and defines ten types of theatre performances - DashaRupakam - Ten Forms of Plays. 
In the course of describing the forms of the plays, the author discusses, the subjects of Vastu(Plot), Netaa(the protagonist), and the Rasa (the emotive aspect) - which are essential to a play.
The Dasharupakam comprises four chapters, each termed as Prakaasha, and has about 300  karikaas (verses) in total, as opposed to the 6000 of the Natya Shastra. In the field of Sanskrit literature it is tradition to use unique word to refer to each chapter in a book. (Other terms used elsewhere include Ullaasas, Parichedaas, Udyota etc.). The author treats Nrutyam,Nruttham  as components of a rupakam' only (play); 
The first chapter describes the rules for rupakam, they key elements of Drama (Vastu-the plot, Netaa(the protagonist), and Rasa (the emotive aspect)). Then discusses the types and characteristics of the Plot

GS1,Battle of Galwan,"The Battle of Galwan was one of the key engagements in the western sector of Ladakh during the Sino-Indian War of 1962. The Galwan Valley, located near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, held strategic significance for both India and China. Tensions escalated in the months leading up to the war, with China seeking to expand its control over disputed territories.

Background
The Indian Army had established outposts in the Galwan Valley as part of its defensive strategy to hold key positions in the region. The area became a flashpoint when Chinese forces launched an offensive in July 1962, attempting to dislodge Indian troops from their positions.

The Battle
In July 1962, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) launched an assault on Indian positions in the Galwan Valley. Despite being under-resourced and fighting at high altitudes, Indian forces fiercely resisted the Chinese advance. The battle was marked by intense fighting in the difficult terrain of the Galwan Valley, with Indian soldiers displaying tenacity and bravery despite the harsh conditions and overwhelming numbers of the enemy.
Indian forces managed to thwart multiple Chinese offensives, inflicting heavy casualties on the PLA. According to reports, Indian troops successfully defended their positions, preventing the Chinese from advancing further into the valley. The battle is remembered as a tactical victory for India, where the Indian Army demonstrated its ability to hold ground in the face of overwhelming odds.

Aftermath
The Battle of Galwan was a significant moment in the Sino-Indian War, demonstrating the determination of the Indian Army to defend its territory in Ladakh. The successful defense of Galwan Valley ensured that China was unable to capture this strategically important area during the early phase of the conflict.
Despite broader setbacks for India in other areas during the war, the victory at Galwan remains a point of pride for the Indian Army. The battle also foreshadowed the"
GS1,Indian copper plate inscriptions,"Indian copper plate inscriptions are legal records engraved on copper plates. The practice was widespread and long-running in the Indian subcontinent; it may date back to as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, however the vast majority of recovered plates were produced in the 1st millennium CE.   The plates were legal documents which registered and recorded an act of endowment, i.e. a grant or donation, typically of land or concessions. The plate contained bureaucratic information on land tenure and taxation essential to the operation of the state.
The copper plates can survive intact indefinitely: copper, being a non-ferrous metal, does not rust or otherwise deteriorate when exposed to oxygen the way iron does, but rather develops a protective patina.

Historical significance
As primary historical documents and archaeological artifacts, the copper plates are invaluable tools for scholarly research in the general history and society of the Indian subcontinent in the 1st millennium CE, and in particular to the early history of Christianity in Asia and the subcontinent. For instance, between the 8th and 10th centuries CE, authorities on the Malabar Coast granted special rights and concessions to the community known as Nasrani (Saint Thomas Christians) which were recorded on copper plates referred to as Cheppeds or Sasanam (""Royal Grants"").

Legal value
As legal documents, historians liken Indian copper plate engravings to a modern-day license or property deed, and suggest that the party claiming ownership of or rights to donated resources would be obligated to show their plates to the state authorities if challenged. As an additional indicator of the legitimacy of the endowment, it was not uncommon for donors to clasp the plates together with a ring bearing the donor's personal seal. As instruments of state expansion, the durability and easy retrievability of the copper plates was crucial to consolidating newly settled lands.

GS1,India: From Midnight to the Millennium,"India: From Midnight to the Millennium is a book written by Shashi Tharoor in 1997. It discusses a wide range of topics like caste, democracy in India, Indira Gandhi, the partition of India, and its transition from a socialist economy to a free market economy.
Shashi Tharoor argues compellingly that India stands at the intersection of the most significant questions facing the world at the end of the twentieth century. If democracy leads to inefficient political infighting, should it be sacrificed in the interest of economic well-being? Does religious fundamentalism provide a way for countries in the developing world to assert their identity in the face of western hegemony, or is there a case for pluralism and diversity amid cultural and religious traditions? Does the entry of Western consumer goods threaten a country's economic self-sufficiency, and is protectionism the only guarantee of independence?  The answers to such questions will determine what kind of world the next century will bring, and since Indians will soon account for a sixth of the world's population, their choices will have repercussions throughout the globe.

GS1,Pipphalivana,"Pipphalivana was the capital of the Moriya republic, a gana- sangha of the Mahajanapada period. The 7th century CE Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang later referred to it by the name of Nyagrodhavana.
Buddhist texts like the Dīgha Nikāya and Buddhavaṃsa suggest that Pipphalivana was the chief town and capital of the Moriyas.

Location
Some say that Pipphalivana probably lay between Rummindei (Lumbini) in the Terai region of Nepal and Kasia in the modern-day Gorakhpur district. The town is identified with Nyagrodhavana (banyan grove), a village in Gorakhpur district which contained the famous Embers' stupa and was mentioned by Hiuen Tsang. Fa-Hien tells us that the stupa lay four yojanas to the east of the river Anoma and twelve yojanas to the west of Kusinara.

Etymology
A tradition explains that the Moriyas took refuge in a pipphalivana (grove of pepper trees) and founded the city Moriyanagara there. The queen of Moriyanagara gave birth to Chandragupta, who was then raised by a herdsman and a hunter.

However, before the end of the ninth century Aparajit was defeated by Aditya I and the Kanchi lands came under the rule of Chola. Pallavas had great contribution to Indian history.
They laid the foundation of Dravidian school of art.

Like other Pallava kings, Aparajit also built a famous Shivan Temple in Thiruttani, Tamil Nadu. This temple is famous for the arch type of Karpagraham (sanctuary). This temple is on the banks of the Nandhi river.

GS1,Battle of Anandpur (1812),"The Battle of Anandpur was fought in 1812 by the Sikh forces led by Sodhi Surjan Singh and the Rajput forces of Kahlur led by Raja Mahan Chand.

Background
The Sikhs had enemies in the Hill States, especially Kahlur. Anandpur was disputed between the Sikhs and Kahlur and they fought many battles starting from 1682 to determine who was the rightful owner of the city. After 1704, the Sikhs had left Anandpur and captured it during the reign of Banda Singh Bahadur. In 1812, the Kahlur Raja Mahan Chand asked Sodhi Surjan Singh to pay tax to him, claiming to own the city. When this was rejected, he attacked Anandpur.

Battle
Sikh general Hukma Singh Chimni was camping near the city when he heard that there was an attack at Anandpur. He and his army marched to the city. There is a vaar called Anandpur Di Var, also referred to as Sodhian Di Var written by Ram Singh about the battle. The troops were defeated with heavy losses and were forced to retreat. The poet states that Bhai Sukkha Singh, author of the book Gurbilas Daswin Patshahi and Bhai Mahna Singh, the Jathedar of Kesgarh fought in this battle.

Aftermath
Instead of receiving tax, the Hill State had to pay the Sikhs the tax. This was the last attack on Anandpur before the colonial era of Punjab.

GS1,Uthiyan Cheralathan,"Uthiyan Cheralathan (c. 130 CE, titles ""Vanavarampan"" or ""Perum Chottu"") is the earliest known Chera ruler of early historic south India (c. 1st - 4th century CE) from extant Tamil literary sources. He is widely regarded as the hero of the lost decad of the Pathitruppathu collection (the first decad) and the earliest recorded ruler of the western coast branch of the Chera dynasty.
His royal consort was Venmal Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan (perhaps of the Ay family). He was succeeded by his son Nedum Cheralathan. Uthiyan Cheralathan was known by the royal epithet ""Vanavarampan"" (meaning either ""One whose kingdom is bounded by the Sky"" or the ""Beloved of the Gods""). The latter title was previously adopted by the Maurya emperor Ashoka.
According to tradition, Uthiyan Cheralathan supplied the rival armies of the epic battle of Mahabharata with sacred rice and/or offered sacrificial rice to his ancestors (hence the title ""Perum Chottu""). The same honor is claimed by the Pandyas and Cholas as well. A later Chera ruler, Kottambalathu Thunchiya Makkothai, locates the great kitchen [attil] of Uthiyan Cheralathan at a location called ""Kuzhumur"" (somewhere in present-day Kerala).
Uthiyan Cheralathan is sometimes identified with Cheraman Perum Cheralathan. Perum Cheralathan was the opponent of Chola ruler Karikala in the battle of Venni. In the battle, the Chera was wounded on the back while leading the warriors. Not being able to bear the disgrace, he committed suicide by slow starvation. It is said that some of his companions also committed suicide unwilling to part with him.

GS1,University of ancient Lohana,"The University of ancient Lohana was a learning centre of Sanskrit education in the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It was located at the Lohana village in the Madhubani district of Bihar. It was destroyed during the British rule in India. The ruins of the ancient university still exist in the village of Lohana. There is a small railway station known as Lohana Road Station near the site of the ruins. Presently there is a Sanskrit College on the site of the ruins which was built and patronised by the king of Raj Darbhanga.

History
According to the historians, Mithila was ruled by Hindu rulers during the period Muslim rule in the northern part of India. During this period, the village of Lohana emerged as a prominent center of Sanskrit education in the patronages of the Brahmins kings of Mithila. It is said that when the universities of Nalanda and Vikramshila were destroyed by the Muslim invaders, then the village of Lohana became the shelter for the Sanskrit scholars who fled from Nalanda and Vikramshila. After that the learning centre of the Lohana village took the form of a university. The Sanskrit scholars from different parts of the Indian subcontinent flocked to the university of Lohana for learning Sanskrit education.
After the arrival of British rule in the sub-continent, when the British rulers took control on the Bengal presidency, then they felt the university of Lohana as an obstacle for expansion of the western culture and the British rule in the region of Mithila. So the British rulers destroyed the university of Lohana and converted it into ruins. Later the university of Lohana gradually disappeared.

GS1,Song Yun,"Song Yun or Songyun (fl. 510s & 520s) was a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled to medieval India from the Tuoba Northern Wei kingdom during China's Northern and Southern dynastic period at the behest of the Empress Hu. He and his companions Huisheng, Fali, and Zheng or Wang Fouze left the Wei capital Luoyang on foot in 518 and returned in the winter of 522 with 170 Buddhist scriptures. Song and Hui's accounts of their journey are now lost but much of their information was preserved in other texts.

Life
Knowledge of Song Yun's bibliography is known primarily from sources derived from the accounts of the journey written by Song and his companion Huisheng or analysis of those sources. He was originally from Dunhuang. Surviving accounts of his journey to India vary in various details. According to the reconstruction of the trip by Édouard Chavannes,

Huisheng [and the others] were sent in the 11th day of the second month of the second Zhengui year (518); he and his companions arrived in Karghalik on the 29th day of the 7th month of the 2nd Zhengui year (519); in the second ten days of the ninth month, they met the king of the Hephthalites; at the beginning of the 11th month, they arrived in Bosi or Boji (southwest of Wakhan); in the second ten days of this same month, they entered Chitral and at the beginning of the 12th month they entered Udyana. Then, during the second ten days of the fourth month of the first Chengkuang year (520), they arrived in Gandhara. They stayed two years in Udyana and Gandhara until returning at the beginning of the third Chengkuang year (522), (and not the second year as one reads in the Account)."" According to legend, they returned through the Congling (or ""Onion"") Mountains where Song Yun met the celebrated Damo or Bodhidharma who had died recently at Luoyang.

GS1,François Bernier,"François Bernier (25 September 1620 – 22 September 1688) was a French physician and traveller. He was born in Joué-Etiau in Anjou. He stayed (14 October 1658 – 20 February 1670) for around 12 years in India.
His 1684 publication ""Nouvelle division de la terre par les différentes espèces ou races qui l'habitent"" (""New Division of the Earth by the Different Species or Races of Man that Inhabit It"") is considered the first published post-Classical classification of humans into distinct races. He also wrote Travels in the Mughal Empire, which is mainly about the reigns of Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb. It is based on his own extensive journeys and observations, and on information from eminent Mughal courtiers who had witnessed the events firsthand.
Bernier abridged and translated the philosophical writings of his friend Pierre Gassendi from Latin into French. Initial editions of Bernier's Abregé de la Philosophie de Gassendi were published in Paris in 1674 by the family Langlois and in 1675 by Estienne Michallet. A complete edition in eight volumes was published by Anisson and Posuel at Lyon in 1678; Anisson and Posuel joined with Rigaud to publish a second edition in seven volumes in 1684. Bernier objectively and faithfully rendered Gassendi's ideas in his Abregé, without editorial interjection or invention. However, Bernier remained uncomfortable with some of Gassendi's notions: in 1682, Estienne Michallet was again his publisher, putting forth his Doutes de Mr. Bernier sur quelques-uns des principaux Chapitres de son Abregé de la Philosophie de Gassendi.

GS1,Herodotus,"Herodotus (Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδοτος, romanized: Hēródotos; c. 484 – c. 425 BC) was a Greek historian and geographer from the Greek city of Halicarnassus (now Bodrum, Turkey), under Persian control in the 5th century BC, and a later citizen of Thurii in modern Calabria, Italy. He wrote the Histories, a detailed account of the Greco-Persian Wars among other subjects such as the rise of the Achaemenid Dynasty of Cyrus, and was the first writer to apply the scientific method to historical events. He has been described as ""The Father of History"", a title conferred on him by the ancient Roman orator Cicero, and the ""Father of Lies"" by others.
The Histories primarily cover the lives of prominent kings and famous battles such as Marathon, Thermopylae, Artemisium, Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale. His work deviates from the main topics to provide a cultural, ethnographical, geographical, and historiographical background that forms an essential part of the narrative and provides readers with a wellspring of additional information. 
Herodotus was criticized in his times for his inclusion of ""legends and fanciful accounts"" in his work. The contemporaneous historian Thucydides who covered the infamous Peloponnesian War in his History of the Peloponnesian War would separately accuse Herodotus of making up stories for entertainment. Herodotus retorted that he reported what he could see and what he was told. A sizable portion of the Histories has since been confirmed by modern historians and archaeologists.

GS2,Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes,"The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, also known as the Water Convention, is an international environmental agreement and one of five UNECE's negotiated environmental treaties.
The purpose of this convention is to improve national attempts and measures for protection and management of transboundary surface waters and groundwaters. On the international level, Parties are obliged to cooperate and create joint bodies. The Convention includes provisions on: monitoring, research, development, consultations, warning and alarm systems, mutual assistance and access as well as exchange of information.
It was opened for signature in Helsinki on 17 March 1992 and entered into force on 6 October 1996. As of November 2022, it has been ratified by 47 parties, which includes 46 states and the European Union. It has been signed but not ratified by the United Kingdom.

About the Convention
Some of the UNECE's water related problems are of water quantity and water quality, high water stress and overexploitation of water resources, increasing droughts and floods, contaminated water resulting in water-related diseases, etc. These issues are even harder to solve due to transboundary nature of the water sources in the UNECE region. More than 150 major rivers and 50 large lakes are either shared or are situated along the borders of two or more countries.
The Water Convention approaches its issues in a holistic way, equally emphasizing the importance of ecosystems, human societies and economies, and stressing the integrated water management instead the previously used focus on specific localized problems.
In 2003, the Water Convention was amended, allowing countries outside the UNECE region to join the convention, and thus benefit from its legal framework and experience; the amendment entered into force in 2013. This is especially beneficial for countries bordering UNECE region.

GS2,Gaetano Mosca,"Gaetano Mosca  (Italian pronunciation: [ɡaeˈtaːno ˈmoska]; 1 April 1858 – 8 November 1941) was an Italian political scientist, journalist and public servant. He is credited with developing the elite theory and the doctrine of the political class and is one of the three members constituting the Italian school of elitism together with Vilfredo Pareto and Robert Michels.

Life
Mosca earned a degree in law from the University of Palermo in 1881. In 1887 he moved to Rome and took a position as editor of proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy. Having taught occasionally at Palermo and Rome, Mosca became chair of constitutional law at the University of Turin in 1896. He would hold this position until 1924, when he settled permanently in Rome to occupy the chair of public law at the University of Rome. Mosca held several other academic positions throughout his life.
He was skeptical towards democracy, and placed his lifelong liberalism in direct opposition to mass democracy. In a 1904 interview, he stated: 

I can certainly call myself an anti-democrat, but I am not an anti-liberal; indeed I am opposed to pure democracy precisely because I am a liberal. I believe that the ruling class ought not to be monolithic and homogeneous but ought to consist of elements which are diverse in regard to origin and interests; when, instead, political power originates from a single source, even if this be elections with universal suffrage, I regard it as dangerous and liable to become oppressive. Democratic Jacobinism is an illiberal doctrine precisely because it subordinates everything to a single force, that of the so-called majority, on which it does not set any limits.
In 1909 Mosca was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, in which he served until 1919.  During this time, he served as Under-secretary for the Colonies from 1914 until 1916. During this time, Mosca also worked as a political journalist for the Corriere della Sera of Milan (after 1901) and the Tribuna of R"
GS2,Treaty of Bhopal,"The Treaty of Bhopal was an agreement signed in 1738 following the Battle of Bhopal, which took place on December 24, 1737. The battle pitted the Maratha Confederacy led by Peshwa Bajirao I against a combined force of the Mughals, Nizam of Hyderabad, the Nawab of Oudh, and other Mughal vassals.

The battle and its aftermath
The Battle of Bhopal, occurring on December 24, 1737, pitted the Maratha Empire against the combined forces of the Mughals, Rajputs, and Nizams. The Marathas secured a decisive victory, largely attributed to the swift tactics of Bajirao Peshwa. Concerned by the Marathas' growing power, the Mughal Emperor called upon the Nizam to assist in driving them out, but Bajirao defeated him near Bhopal in December 1737, compelling him to agree to Maratha terms. This led to the signing of the humiliating Treaty of Bhopal on January 7, 1738, wherein the Nizam ceded Malwa to the Marathas and the Mughals agreed to pay 5,000,000 as indemnity.

Terms of the treaty
Mughal concessions: The Mughal Empire agreed to pay a significant financial sum of 5,000,000 rupees to the Marathas as war indemnity.
Maratha gains: The Marathas secured territorial concessions, potentially including the Malwa territories.
Bhopal's status: The Nawab of Bhopal, Dost Mohammad Khan, who had sided with the Mughals, might have retained his position but became a tributary of the Marathas.

GS2,Definition of terrorism,"There is no legal or scientific consensus on the definition of terrorism. Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism, and governments have been reluctant to formulate an agreed-upon legally-binding definition. Difficulties arise from the fact that the term has become politically and emotionally charged. A simple definition proposed to the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) by terrorism studies scholar Alex P. Schmid in 1992, based on the already internationally accepted definition of war crimes, as ""peacetime equivalents of war crimes"", was not accepted.
Scholars have worked on creating various academic definitions, reaching a consensus definition published by Schmid and A. J. Jongman in 1988, with a longer revised version published by Schmid in 2011, some years after he had written that ""the price for consensus [had] led to a reduction of complexity"". The Cambridge History of Terrorism (2021), however, states that Schmid's ""consensus"" resembles an intersection of definitions, rather than a bona fide consensus.
The United Nations General Assembly condemned terrorist acts by using the following political description of terrorism in December 1994 (GA Res. 49/60):

Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.

Etymology
The term ""terrorism"" comes from French terrorisme, from Latin: terror, ""great fear"", ""dread"", related to the Latin verb terrere, ""to frighten"". 
The French National Convention declared in September 1793 that ""terror is the order of the day"". The period 1793–94 is referred to as La Terreur (Reign of Terror). Maximilien Robespierre, a leader in the French Revolution proclaimed i"

GS2,Transgender Day of Remembrance,"The Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR), also known as the International Transgender Day of Remembrance, has been observed annually from its inception on November 20 to memorialize those who have been murdered as a result of transphobia. The day was founded to draw attention to the continued violence directed toward transgender people.
Transgender Day of Remembrance was founded in 1999 by a small group, including Gwendolyn Ann Smith, Nancy Nangeroni, and Jahaira DeAlto, to memorialize the murders of Black transgender women Rita Hester in Allston, Massachusetts, and Chanelle Pickett in Watertown, Massachusetts. After Hester's death in 1998, Smith was surprised to realize that none of her friends remembered Pickett or her murder three years prior, saying ""It really surprised me that it had already, in a short period of time, been forgotten, and here we were with another murder at the same site.” The first TDoR took place in November 1999 in Boston and San Francisco, as both Hester and Pickett's deaths occurred in November. TDoR continued to be observed annually on November 20, the anniversary of Pickett's murder. In 2010, TDoR was observed in over 185 cities throughout more than 20 countries.
Typically, a TDoR memorial includes a reading of the names of those who died from October 1 of the former year to September 30th of the current year, and may include other actions, such as candlelight vigils, dedicated church services, marches, art shows, food drives, and film screenings. GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) has extensively covered TDoR, interviewed numerous transgender advocates (including actress Candis Cayne), profiled an event at the New York City LGBT Community Center, and discussed media coverage of TDoR.

GS2,Alluvion (Roman law),"Alluvion, is a Roman law method of acquisition of heritable property (land). The typical cause is sediment (alluvium) deposited by a river. This sediment, legally termed the accessory, accreses (i.e., merges with) a piece of land, the principal (operating a subtype of the Roman mode of acquisition by accession) and thus accedes to the ownership of the principal land over time. 
It continues to have relevance in the modern age from adopting Roman property law by modern legal systems, primarily civil law jurisdictions. Scots law is a notable example of the usage of alluvion within the law of accession (accesio). Public international law also recognises the acquisition of sovereignty of virgin territory by operation of nature, such as sediment deposits, again following the Roman law principles of alluvion.

GS2,Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China,"The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) is an international, cross-party alliance of parliamentarians from democratic countries focused on relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), and specifically, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It was established on June 4, 2020, on the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The alliance comprises over 240 members from 27 legislatures and the European Parliament. Each legislature represented takes turns to chair the alliance on a rotating basis. Its purpose is to create a coordinated response to China on global trade, security and human rights.

History
Founding
In its founding statement, the alliance stated that ""countries that have tried to stand up to Beijing have mostly done so alone — and often at great cost."" Many of those who first signed the declaration have been affected by overseas censorship of Chinese issues in recent years. Co-chair James Paterson and member Andrew Hastie were banned from visiting China after meeting with Uyghur dissidents and writing about the threat of China to Australian democracy. Germany's co-chair Michael Brand experienced ""massive pressure"" to delete comments about Tibet and later had a travel ban imposed on him. Canadian parliamentarians joined the alliance after the CCP restricted imports on some Canadian goods and detained Canadians nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig as a tit for tat for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou on charges of fraud. Belgium co-chair Samuel Cogolati being the subject of cyber attack by a Chinese state actor, after writing a resolution on Uyghur Muslims in China, and Els Van Hoof being warned by China not to visit Taiwan. Sweden's co-chair Fredrik Malm spoke at a solidarity rally for Hong Kong in September 2019. Some weeks later China's Ambassador to Sweden, Gui Congyou addressed Swedish listeners and said,  ""We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns."" This type of intimidating lan"
GS2,Offshoring,"Offshoring is the relocation of a business process from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, or supporting processes, such as accounting. Usually this refers to a company business, although state governments may also employ offshoring. More recently, technical and administrative services have been offshored.
Offshoring neither implies nor precludes involving a different company to be responsible for a business process. Therefore, offshoring should not be confused with outsourcing which does imply one company relying on another. In practice, the concepts can be intertwined, i.e offshore outsourcing, and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed, as described by terms such as reshoring, inshoring, and insourcing.
In-house offshoring is when the offshored work is done by means of an internal (captive) delivery model.
Imported services from subsidiaries or other closely related suppliers are included, whereas intermediate goods, such as partially completed
cars or computers, may not be.

Motivation
Lower cost and increased profitability are often the motivation for offshoring. Economists call this labor arbitrage. More recently, offshoring incentives also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and decreasing the time to market.
Jobs are added in the destination country providing the goods or services and are subtracted from the higher-cost labor country. The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the United States due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.

Criteria
Some criteria for a job to be offshore-able are:

There is a significant wage difference between the original and offshore countries
Remote work is possible in the job
The work can be transmitted over the In"
GS2,Plenipotentiary,"A plenipotentiary (from the Latin plenus ""full"" and potens ""powerful"") is a diplomat who has full powers—authorization to sign a treaty or convention on behalf of a sovereign. When used as a noun more generally, the word can also refer to any person who has full powers. As an adjective, it describes something which confers full powers, such as an edict or an assignment.

Diplomats
Before the era of rapid international transport or essentially instantaneous communication (such as telegraphy in the mid-19th century and then radio), diplomatic mission chiefs were granted full (plenipotentiary) powers to represent their government in negotiations with their host nation. Conventionally, any representations made or agreements reached with a plenipotentiary would be recognized and complied with by their government.
Historically, the common generic term for high diplomats of the crown or state was minister. It therefore became customary to style the chiefs of full ranking missions as minister plenipotentiary. This position was roughly equivalent to the modern ambassador, a term that historically was reserved mainly for missions between the great powers and also relating to the city-state of Venice.
Permanent missions at a bilateral level were chiefly limited to relations between large, neighboring or closely allied powers, rarely to the very numerous small principalities, hardly worth the expense. Diplomatic missions were dispatched for specific tasks, such as negotiating a treaty bilaterally, or via a conference of plenipotentiaries, such as the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. In such cases, it was normal to send a representative minister empowered to cast votes. For example, in the Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolution, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and John Jay were named ""minister plenipotentiary of the United States"" to the Netherlands, France and Spain, respectively.
By the time of the Vienna Congress (1814–15), which codified diplomatic relations, a"
GS2,Grey-zone (international relations),"The grey-zone (also grey zone, gray zone, and gray-zone) describes the space in between peace and war in which state and non-state actors engage in competition.

Definition
Use of the term grey-zone is widespread in national security circles, but there is no universal agreement on the definition of grey-zone, or even whether it is a useful term, with views about the term ranging from ""faddish"" or ""vague"", to ""useful"" or ""brilliant"".
The grey-zone is defined as ""competitive interactions among and within state and non-state actors that fall between the traditional war and peace duality."" by the United States Special Operations Command. A key element of operations within the grey-zone is that they remain below the threshold of an attack which could have a legitimate conventional military response (jus ad bellum). One paper defined it as ""coercive statecraft actions short of war"", and a ""mainly non-military domain of human activity in which states use national resources to deliberately coerce other states"". The Center for Strategic and International Studies defines the grey-zone as ""the contested arena somewhere between routine statecraft and open warfare."" British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace called the grey-zone ""that limbo land between peace and war.""
Grey zone warfare generally means a middle, unclear space that exists between direct conflict and peace in international relations.
According to Vincent Cable, examples of grey-zone activities include undermining industrial value chains or oil and gas supplies, money laundering, and the use of espionage and sabotage. According to Lee Hsi-ming ""gray zone conflict is characterized by using the threat of force to create fear and intimidation."" US Navy admiral Samuel Paparo has termed gray zone activities ""illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive"" (ICAP) following the preferred term of Romeo Brawner Jr.

History
The term grey-zone was coined by the United States Special Operations Command and published in a 2015 white p"
GS2,Nuclear ethics,"Nuclear ethics is a cross-disciplinary field of academic and policy-relevant study in which the problems associated with nuclear warfare, nuclear deterrence, nuclear arms control, nuclear disarmament, or nuclear energy are examined through one or more ethical or moral theories or frameworks.
Nuclear ethics assumes that the very real possibilities of human extinction, mass human destruction, or mass environmental damage which could result from nuclear warfare are deep ethical or moral problems. Specifically, it assumes that the outcomes of human extinction, mass human destruction, or environmental damage count as moral evils.  Another area of inquiry concerns future generations and the burden that nuclear waste and pollution imposes on them.  Some scholars have concluded that it is therefore morally wrong to act in ways that produce these outcomes, which means it is morally wrong to engage in nuclear warfare.
Nuclear ethics is interested in examining policies of nuclear deterrence, nuclear arms control and disarmament, and nuclear energy insofar as they are linked to the cause or prevention of nuclear warfare. Ethical justifications of nuclear deterrence, for example, emphasize its role in preventing great power nuclear war since the end of World War II. Indeed, some scholars claim that nuclear deterrence seems to be the morally rational response to a nuclear-armed world. Moral condemnation of nuclear deterrence, in contrast, emphasizes the seemingly inevitable violations of human and democratic rights which arise. In contemporary security studies, the problems of nuclear warfare, deterrence, proliferation, and so forth are often understood strictly in political, strategic, or military terms. In the study of international organizations and law, however, these problems are also understood in legal terms.
Nuclear technology has seen the formation of an anti-nuclear movement since its early development, and grew with the increased impact of it, particularly nuclear weap"
GS2,Day of the Imprisoned Writer,"The Day of the Imprisoned Writer is an annual, international day intended to recognize and support writers who resist repression of the basic human right to freedom of expression and who stand up to attacks made against their right to impart information.  This day is observed each year on November 15.  It was started in 1981 by PEN International's Writers in Prison Committee.
In addition to increasing the public's awareness of persecuted writers in general, PEN uses the Day of the Imprisoned Writer to direct attention to several specific persecuted or imprisoned writers and their individual circumstances.  Each of the selected writers is from a different part of the world, and each case represents circumstances of repression that occur when governments or other entities in power feel threatened by what writers have written.  On this day, the general public is encouraged to take action—in the form of donations and letters of appeal—on behalf of the selected writers.
The day also serves to commemorate all of the writers killed since the previous year's Day of the Imprisoned Writer.  Between November 15, 2007, and November 15, 2008, at least 39 writers from around the world were killed in circumstances that appeared to be related to their professions.

GS2,Health Level 7,"Health Level Seven, abbreviated to HL7, is a range of global standards for the transfer of clinical and administrative health data between applications with the aim to improve patient outcomes and health system performance. The HL7 standards focus on the application layer, which is ""layer 7"" in the Open Systems Interconnection model. The standards are produced by Health Level Seven International, an international standards organization, and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as American National Standards Institute and International Organization for Standardization. There are a range of primary standards that are commonly used across the industry, as well as secondary standards which are less frequently adopted.

Purpose
Health organizations typically have many different computer systems used to process different patient administration or clinical tasks, such as billing, medication management, patient tracking, and documentation. All of these systems should communicate, or ""interface"", with each other when they receive new information or when they wish to retrieve information. HL7 International specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which these healthcare systems can communicate with each other. The standards allow for easier 'interoperability' of healthcare data as it is shared and processed uniformly and consistently by the different systems. This allows clinical and non-clinical data to be shared more easily, theoretically improving patient care and health system performance.

Primary standards
HL7 International considers the following standards to be its primary standards – those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:

Version 2.x Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions
Version 3 Messaging Standard – an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions
Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) – an exchange model for clinical documen"
GS2,Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States),"United States Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR USA) was founded in 1915 by sixty-eight pacifists, including  A. J. Muste,  Jane Addams and Bishop Paul Jones, and claims to be the ""largest, oldest interfaith peace and justice organization in the United States."" Norman Thomas, at first skeptical of its program, joined in 1916 and would become the group's president. Its programs and projects involve domestic as well as international issues, and generally emphasize nonviolent alternatives to conflict and the rights of conscience. Unlike the U.K. movements, it is an interfaith body, though its historic roots are in Christianity. Both the FOR in the United States and similarly named organizations in other countries are affiliated with the International Fellowship of Reconciliation.

History
Origins in World War I and activities through the 1940s
FOR in the USA was formed initially in opposition to the entry of the United States into World War I. The American Civil Liberties Union developed out of FOR's conscientious objectors program and the Emergency Committee for Civil Liberties.
In 1918, FOR and the American Federation of Labor formed Brookwood Labor College, which lasted until 1937. Also in January 1918, FOR began publication of The World Tomorrow, with Norman Thomas as its first editor.
National Secretary Paul Jones wrote in 1921 that the Fellowship of Reconciliation was established as one vehicle to aid in the application of Christian principles to ""every problem of life."" In addition to the impossibility of harmonizing war with ""the way of Christ,"" Jones stated that members of the organization had come to believe in the parallel necessity of a ""reorganization of Society as will establish it on a Christian basis, so that no individual may be exploited for the profit or pleasure of another."" Rather than the FOR itself serving as the primary fulcrum for this activity, ""in general the members of the Fellowship endeavor to work out their aims through existing organizat"
GS2,Chinese salami slicing strategy,"China's salami slicing (Chinese: 蚕食; pinyin: Cán shí; transl. ""nibbling like a silkworm"") is a geopolitical strategy involving a series of small steps allegedly taken by the government of People's Republic of China that would become a larger gain which would have been difficult or unlawful to perform all at once. When discussing this concept, notedly debated in the publications of the Lowy Institute from Australia, some defenders of the concept are Brahma Chellaney, Jasjit Singh, Bipin Rawat or the Observer Research Foundation from India or the United States Institute of Peace, Bonnie S. Glaser (Center for Strategic and International Studies) or Erik Voeten (The Washington Post) from the US, while detractors are H. S. Panag from India or Linda Jakobson. Advocates of the term have cited examples such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and along the Sino-Indian border.

Modus operandi
According to Indian strategist and writer Brahma Chellaney, ""salami slicing"" rather than overt aggression is China's favored strategy because none of its series of small actions serves as a casus belli by itself. China slices very thinly, camouflaging offense as defense, and eventually gains a larger strategic advantage. This throws its targets off balance by presenting a Hobson’s choice: either silently suffer or risk an expensive and dangerous war with China. This can also place the blame and burden of starting a war on the targets.

Dimensions
Proponents of the salami slicing strategy allege that China has used this in political, economic, and military realms.

India
Indian authors accuse China of using piecemeal claims to expand its territory at India's expense. Brahma Chellaney has cited China's incorporation of Aksai Chin in a step-by-step process between 1952 and 1964, its 2020-2021 border skirmishes with India, and Tajikistan's Pamir Mountains as examples. The Five Fingers of Tibet involving Nepal and Bhutan as well as the String of Pearls in the Indian Ocean have"
GS2,International reactions to the 2016 Kashmir unrest,"The 2016 Kashmir Riots , also known as the Burhan aftermath, refers to protests in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, chiefly in the Kashmir Valley. It started after the killing of militant leader Burhan Wani by Indian security forces on 8 July 2016. Wani was a commander of the Kashmir-based Islamist militant organisation Hizbul Mujahideen.
Curfew was imposed in all 10 districts of the valley on 15 July and mobile services were suspended. Protests started in all 10 districts of the Kashmir Valley. Protesters defied curfew with attacks on security forces and public properties. Kashmir valley then remained under 53 consecutive days of curfew. The curfew was lifted on 31 August, but was reimposed in some areas the next day.
Jammu and Kashmir police and Indian paramilitary forces used pellet guns, tear gas shells, rubber bullets, as well as assault rifles. More than 90 civilians were killed and over 15,000 civilians were injured, including many who were blinded by pellet guns. Two security personnel died and over 4,000 were injured.
Columnists including Prem Shankar Jha termed the unrest as Kashmir's Intifada.

Background
In the 2014 Indian general election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a majority in the Lower House of the Indian Parliament. Narendra Modi became the prime minister. In the accompanying state Legislative Assembly elections the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won a majority of the seats in Kashmir and the BJP won the majority in Jammu. Even though the parties campaigned against each other, they formed a coalition government, with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed as chief minister. Following Sayeed's death in 2016, his daughter Mehbooba Mufti took over as chief minister, becoming the first female chief minister of the state.
In late 2015 and early 2016, observers of Kashmir reported growth in Islamic militancy and increased radicalization of the Kashmiri Muslim population. Reasons for the growth included the absence of political dialogue, lack of economic o"

GS2,Confiscation of Russian central bank funds,"Within days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 western countries moved to freeze Russian central bank funds in these countries. In March 2023 (prior to the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam) a joint assessment was released by the Government of Ukraine, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the United Nations, estimating the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine to be US$411 billion (€383 billion). This could eventually exceed $1 trillion (€911 billion), depending on the course of the war. The Kyiv School of Economics has a project and website dedicated to detailing the damages the war has caused to Ukraine. The G7 countries plus the European Union announced in May 2023 that the approximately $300 billion (€275 billion) in Russian central bank assets that had been frozen in these countries would remain frozen ""until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,"" and this was reaffirmed after the G7 meeting in December, 2023. This constituted about half of the $612 billion (€560 billion) total foreign currency and gold reserves held at that time by the Russian central bank. By late July 2023, the amount of frozen Russian assets held in these countries was estimated at $335 billion (€300 billion). Most frozen assets, by far, reside in Europe ($217 billion (€201 billion) to $230 billion (€210 billion)), with the United States holding just a small portion ($5 billion (€4.5 billion)) and Japan also holding some. Josep Borrell, EU's foreign affairs chief, said he wants EU countries to confiscate the frozen assets to cover the costs of rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Russian deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko remarked that Borrell's initiative amounted to ""complete lawlessness"" and said it would hurt Europe if adopted. Russia has threatened to retaliate by confiscating assets owned by the EU. Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg warned that confiscation of Russian assets that does not have a ""watertight"" justi"

GS2,International trade law,"International trade law includes the appropriate rules and customs for handling trade between countries. However, it is also used in legal writings as trade between private sectors. This branch of law is now an independent field of study as most governments have become part of the world trade, as members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since the transaction between private sectors of different countries is an important part of the WTO activities, this latter branch of law is now part of the academic works and is under study in many universities across the world.

Overview
International trade law should be distinguished from the broader field of international economic law.  The latter could be said to encompass not only WTO law, but also law governing the international monetary system and currency regulation, as well as the law of international development.
The international trade law includes rules, regulations and customs governing trade between nations. International trade law is the tool used by the nation’s government for taking corrective actions against trade. International trade law focuses on applying domestic rules to international trade rules and applying treaty-based international trade law governing trade.
The body of rules for transnational trade in the 21st century was derived from medieval commercial laws called the lex mercatoria and lex maritima—respectively, ""the law for merchants on land"" and ""the law for merchants on the sea."" Modern trade law (extending beyond bilateral treaties) began shortly after the Second World War, with the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to deal with trade in goods: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
International trade law is based on theories of economic liberalism developed in Europe and later the United States from the 18th century onwards.

GS2,Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa,"The Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa (CHRDA) is a human rights organisation documenting human rights violations and promoting human rights improvements in Africa, with a particular focus on Cameroon, where the organisation started.

History
The CHRDA started as a Cameroonian human rights organisation called the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Cameroon. In 2005, after discussions with colleagues from other parts of Africa and from the United States (US), the group added regional offices in Sierra Leone and the US and changed its name to the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Africa.

Anglophone crisis
The CHRDA is well known for its documentation of human rights violations during the Anglophone crisis, a civil war involving the Southern Cameroons region of Cameroon that started in 2017. In August 2018, the CHRDA published a list of 106 villages that had been raided and burnt down by Cameroonian government forces since October 2017. Citing eyewitness accounts, videos and photos as evidence, the CHRDA claimed that the 106 villages had been ""attacked, burned down partially or completely and deserted either completely or partially"".
In May 2019, CHRDA together with the Montreal-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights claimed that human rights violations in the Anglophone crisis constituted crimes against humanity.

GS2,Medcities,"Medcities is a network of Mediterranean coastal cities created in Barcelona in 1991 at the initiative of the Mediterranean Technical Assistance Programmes (METAP). The METAP, whose objective is environmental improvement in the Mediterranean region, was established in 1990 by the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the United Nations Development Programme.
The goals of the network are to strengthen the environmental management capability of local administration, through decentralised activities involving technical assistance, and also to reinforce awareness of interdependence and common responsibility regarding the policies of urban environmental conservation in the Mediterranean basin.

History
The creation of Medcities was a consequence of METAP's objective of strengthening decentralised actions involving technical assistance as the best means of promoting awareness of urban environmental problems and making those actions into a vehicle for empowering municipalities in developing countries in respect of management of urban environmental issues. Medcities continues offering this support. Afterwards, Medcities has extended its activities from the initial local environment to the wider local sustainable development field.

Objectives
The Medcities network is a tool to strengthen the environmental and sustainable development management capability of local administration, but it is also useful in order to identify the domains where a common activation could be the most useful means to improve the regional environmental conditions.
The goals of the Medcities Network are the following:

GS2,Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft,"The Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft is an American think tank specializing in foreign policy of the United States. Founded in 2019, the Quincy Institute has been described as advocating realism and restraint in foreign policy. 
The organization is located in Washington, D.C., and is named after former US president John Quincy Adams.

History
The Quincy Institute was co-founded by Andrew Bacevich, a former US Army officer who fought in the Vietnam War and later became a professor of history at Boston University. Bacevich is currently chairman of the board at the Quincy Institute.
Initial funding for the group, launched in November 2019, included half a million dollars each from George Soros' Open Society Foundations and Charles Koch's Koch Foundation. Substantial funding has also come from the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and Schumann Center for Media and Democracy. The institute distinguishes itself from many other think tanks in Washington, D.C. by refusing to accept money from foreign governments.
The think tank is named after US President John Quincy Adams who, as secretary of state, said in a speech on July 4, 1821, that the US ""goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy."" It has been described as ""realist"" and ""promot[ing] an approach to the world based on diplomacy and restraint rather than threats, sanctions, and bombing.""
David Klion wrote: ""Quincy's founding members say again and again that 9/11 and the Iraq War were turning points in their careers.""

Purpose
The Quincy Institute states that it is a nonprofit research organization and think tank that hosts scholars, participates in debates, publishes analysis pieces by journalists and academics, and advocates for a ""less militarized and more cooperative foreign policy"". According to its statement of purpose, it is opposed to the military-industrial complex described by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his farewell address.

GS2,Document Freedom Day,"Document Freedom Day (DFD) is an annual event to ""celebrate and raise awareness of Open Standards"". It is celebrated on the last Wednesday of March each year. Document Freedom Day was first celebrated on 26 March 2008, and has continued to be celebrated every year since.
Document Freedom Day is organised by a team of volunteers of the Digital Freedom Foundation since 2016. It was previously organised by the Free Software Foundation Europe. DFD is funded by donors and partners which vary from year to year.
DFD 2013 was the largest ever with 60 events in 30 countries. A year later, in 2014, 51 groups in 22 countries held events celebrating Document Freedom Day. In 2019 it took place on Wednesday 27 March.

Relationship to free software
Document Freedom Day is a campaign about open standards and document formats, aimed at a non-technical audience. Open standards ensure communication is independent of software vendor; this, in turn, ensures that people ""are able to communicate and work using Free Software.""
Document freedom addresses much more than just essays and spreadsheets, it is about control of any kind of a digital data - including artwork, sheet and recorded music, email, and statistics. These can be stored in ways which empower users, but they can also be stored in formats which constrain and manipulate users at enormous cost. Documents that are not free are locked to some particular software or company. The author cannot choose how to use them because they are controlled by technical restrictions.

Relationship to open standards
According to Document Freedom volunteers, ""Open Standards are essential for interoperability and freedom of choice based on the merits of different software applications. They provide freedom from data lock-in and the subsequent supplier lock-in. This makes Open Standards essential for governments, companies, organisations and individual users of information technology.""

GS2,Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe,"The Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe was an institution aimed at strengthening peace, democracy, human rights and economy in the countries of South Eastern Europe from 1999 to 2008.  It was replaced by the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) in February 2008. The RCC replaced it because it is more ""regionally owned"" than the Stability Pact, which was driven more by outside partners such as the EU.

Creation
The pact was created at the initiative of the European Union on June 10, 1999, in Cologne. All of the countries of the region, except for Serbia and Montenegro (then FR Yugoslavia) and Moldova, were present at the founding conference. Representatives of Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Turkey, United States, all members of the EU at the time, OSCE, Council of Europe and European Commission were also considered active participants.
Representatives of Canada, Japan, United Nations, UNHCR, NATO, OECD, Western European Union, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were present as facilitators.
The pact was created following the escalation of Kosovo War; stability of Kosovo was among the primary objectives.
In 2006 it was announced that the Stability Pact should be succeeded in early 2008 by a more regionally owned co-operation framework, the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) formed by the countries of the region themselves, but "
GS2,Territorial integrity,"Territorial integrity is the principle under international law where sovereign states have a right to defend their borders and all territory in them from another state. It is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and has been recognized as customary international law. Under this principle, forcible imposition of a border change is an act of aggression. 
In the post-World War years, there has been tension between this principle and the concept of humanitarian intervention under Article 73.b of the United Nations Charter ""to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions, according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages of advancement."" 
Some of the strongest safeguards of territorial integrity are rule of law such as Charter of the United Nations and nuclear deterrence.
Scholars have debated the existence of a territorial integrity norm since the end of World War II. Conquest of large swaths of territory has been rare, but states have since 1945 continued to pursue (and often successfully) the violent annexation of small swaths of territory.

History
Prior to the modern era, there was not a clearly defined system of international boundaries. Rather, authority over territorial spaces was non-linear, often overlapping and shifting. According to Mark Zacher, ""precisely surveyed national borders only came into clear view in the eighteenth century"". Guntram Herb dates the emergence of clearly defined political territories to the 15th century.
The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 is commonly considered to have established territorial integrity as a cornerstone of sovereignty, embodied in the concept of Westphalian sovereignty, but even this did not necessarily reflect any absolute right to particular territory. Even after Westphalia, territorial exchange remained common between states. In turn"
GS2,Proxeny,"Proxeny or proxenia (Ancient Greek: προξενία) in ancient Greece was an arrangement whereby a citizen (chosen by the city) hosted foreign ambassadors at his own expense, in return for honorary titles from the state. The citizen was called proxenos (πρόξενος; plural: proxenoi or proxeni, ""instead of a foreigner"") or proxeinos (πρόξεινος). The proxeny decrees, which amount to letters patent and resolutions of appreciation were issued by one state to a citizen of another for service as proxenos, a kind of honorary consul looking after the interests of the other state's citizens. A common phrase is euergetes (benefactor) and proxenos (πρόξεινος τε ειη και ευεργέτης).
A proxenos would use whatever influence he had in his own city to promote policies of friendship or alliance with the city he voluntarily represented. For example, Cimon was Sparta's proxenos at Athens and during his period of prominence in Athenian politics, previous to the outbreak of the First Peloponnesian War, he strongly advocated a policy of cooperation between the two states. Cimon was known to be so fond of Sparta that he named one of his sons Lacedaemonius (as Sparta was known as Lacedaemon in antiquity).
Being another city's proxenos did not preclude taking part in war against that city, should it break out – since the proxenos' ultimate loyalty was to his own city. However, a proxenos would naturally try his best to prevent such a war and to resolve the differences that were threatening to cause it. And once peace negotiations were on the way, a proxenos' contacts and goodwill in the enemy city could be profitably used by his city.
The position of proxenos for a particular city was often hereditary in a particular family.
A 2024 study in the Journal of Economic History linked the presence of proxeny arrangements to increases in trade flows.

4: The last German troops surrender on Svalbard.
5: Singapore is officially liberated by British and Indian troops.
6: The US Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan, which governs US policy in the occupation of Japan, is approved by Truman.
9: The Japanese troops in China formally surrender.
12: Japanese rule of Korea ends after Governor General Nobuyuki Abe stands down.
13: British forces under Major-General Douglas Gracey's 20th Indian Division, some 26,000 men in all, arrive in Saigon to disarm and accept the surrender of the Japanese Occupation Forces in Vietnam south of the 16th parallel. 180,000 Chinese Nationalist soldiers, mainly poor peasants, arrive in Hanoi to disarm and accept surrender north of the line. After looting Vietnamese villages during their entire march down from China, they then proceed to loot Hanoi.

22: The British rearm 1,400 French soldiers from Japanese internment camps around Saigon. In Saigon, on the night of 24 September, a mob composed of Viet-Minh militants and sympathizers attacks French colonial administration and kills around 150 European civilians. An estimated 20,000 French civilians live in Saigon.

GS2,List of countries by hospital beds,"The number of beds per people is an important indicator of the health care system of a country. The basic measure focus on all hospital beds, which are variously split and occupied. The classic hospital beds are also called curative beds. For severe patients with risk of organ(s) failure, patients are provided intensive care unit beds (aka ICU bed) or critical care beds (CCB).
Among OECD countries, curative beds' occupancy rate average was 75%, from 94.9% (Ireland) to 61.6% (Greece), with half of the OECD's nation between 70% and 80%.
In 2009, European nations, most of those that are also part of OECD, had an aggregated total of nearly 2.1 million acute beds and 73,585 critical care beds (CCB) or 11.5CCB/100,000 inhabitants. Germany had 29.2, Portugal 4.2.
Aging population leads to increased demand for CCB and difficulties to satisfy it, while both quantity of CCB and availability are poorly documented.
Base capacity for lower-income countries is approximately 0.1 ICU beds per 100,000 citizens.

Data
2020 coronavirus pandemic
The availability of CCB-ICU beds, mechanical ventilation and ECMO devices generally closely associated with hospital beds has been described as a critical bottleneck in responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of such devices dramatically raises the mortality rate of COVID-19.
In early March, the UK government supported a strategy to develop natural herd immunity, drawing sharp criticism from medical personnel and researchers. Various forecasts by Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, made public on March 16, suggested that the peak number of cases in the UK would require between 100 and 225 CCBs / 100,000 inhabitants, if proper mitigation or no mitigation strategies are put into force, respectively. These requirements would both exceed the UK's current capacities of 6.6–14 CCB / 100,000 inhabitants. In the best case scenario, the peak caseload would require 7.5 times the current number of available ICU beds. Around March 16, th"
GS2,Transnational marriage in Japan,"An international marriage in Japan is a marriage between a Japanese and a non-Japanese person, in accordance with the formalities provided by the law of Japan or of a foreign land. Procedures and rules mentioned in this article are mainly those of Japan, but in some cases other requirements are imposed by the homeland of the non-Japanese spouse, or by the foreign land where the concerned couple marry. In general the legality of a marriage for each spouse is determined by the homeland law of the spouse.

History
Marriage between a Japanese national and a non-Japanese person was first officially permitted by act of law on March 14, 1873 (6th year of the Meiji Period), before the former Meiji Constitution (1889) and the former Nationality Law (1899). This day is informally known as International Marriage Day (国際結婚の日)
International marriage at the time required both a permit and surrender of recognised social standing (分限).
During 1986 to 1991, the period of Japanese bubble economy, labor shortages for ""3D jobs"" (dirty, dangerous, and demeaning) occurred in Japan. This situation created expand the migrant labor rates. However, the revised policy in 1990 prohibited unrestricted economic activities except for only four kinds of visa, which include the ""Spouse or child of a Japanese national"". This policy legalizes all kinds of economic activity for marriage migrations.

Homeland law
According to an Act of Japan on general rules, 

The homeland law of a person is the law of the country of citizenship of the person.
If a person has more than one citizenship, and if one of the citizenships is Japan, the homeland law is the law of Japan;
If a person has more than one citizenship, and none of them is Japanese, the homeland law of the person is the law of the country where the person habitually lives.
as to a concerned person with nationality of a nation in which laws are different according to locality (like the US), the homeland law is the local law under rules of the nation "

In 2011, the IAEA investigators and the investigative report by the Washington Post leveled serious allegations on him as a ""foreign expert"" and accused him of being a central figure in the nuclear program of Iran after the Soviet collapse in 1991.

Soviet Union
From 1955 until 1991, Danilenko worked as a physicist in the  former Soviet program of nuclear weapons, where he was based in the NII-1011 facility which is located in the closed city of Chelyabinsk-70. His initial work was focused on Nanodiamond that were produced from detonation of former Soviet nuclear devices in the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan. He later gained expertise in the Detonation nanodiamond–a technology developed 
from the former Soviet program that improved the detonation process.

Post-Soviet years
Ukraine
After the Soviet dissolution, he moved to Kyiv in Ukraine, where he ran a private company called ALIT, which was known for producing diamonds. In 2004, he authored a paper on nanodiamonds.

Iran
In 2011 the Washington Post released an article alleging that he provided expertise in the development of nuclear detonators for the country at their Physics Research Centre between 1996 and 2002, and cited a report published by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

GS2,Neocolonial racism,"Neocolonial racism is a subgroup of racism, inspired by the power dynamics left by the power and wealth disparages of a colonial landscape.
This subgroup of racism is typified by a hierarchy of classes dictated by race or ethnic group whose place in the hierarchy coincides with the level of the ethnic group during time of the foreign control; often colonial racism is seen as a power tool of elites to maintain order.  Some qualities of the racism include a mainstream history that is imposed by elites, ""willfully accepted false memories"" of popular icons who fought the racial ideas, and large disparages between the elite of colonial ruler ethnicity and the poor of the colonized ethnicity.  Most often this type of racism lends to continuous and long term violence, but it can also include power dynamics continued by volunteering activities.  It does not apply when Native peoples dominate the political landscape after an uprising or forced destruction of the invaders control, nor when the invasion itself was ineffective and never completed.

Types and Forms
Volunteer tourism, in which international volunteers seek to aid poorer countries has been critiqued as a practice as teaching neocolonialism and racism among the international community.  Proponents cite the power differences between the volunteers and indigenous folk, as well as interactions between the groups being decided on race and gender differences rather than other factors.
Colorblindness, not to be confused with the eye condition, has been critiqued as a practice of hiding racism by eradicating any comment about race from dialogue while still allowing racist sentiments to continue.  In this manner, the effects of racism can be denied in legal court due to the non-use of any designated racist comments.  Meanwhile, proponents of colorblindness maintain its use in preventing racist beliefs as a different explanation or perspective must be used instead of an overtly racist one.

History
World Fiddle Day was founded by County Donegal fiddler Caoimhin Mac Aoidh in 2012. The May date was chosen to coincide with the 1737 death of Italian violin craftsman Antonio Stradivari. The first Toronto celebration was held in 2013 and that year there was a celebration in Winnipeg as well.
In 2015, Canada declared World Fiddle Day to be National Fiddle Day as well. There were celebrations in Owen Sound, Ontario, St. John's, Newfoundland and Toronto.  The Ottawa Fiddle and Stepdancing Competition was held in Richmond, Ontario.
In 2016 a World Fiddle Day celebration was held at Fort York in Toronto on May 21. Yosvani Castañeda Valdés demonstrated Cuban fiddling, while Dan MacDonald performed and presented a workshop about Cape Breton fiddling style. Other events were held in Owen Sound, Ontario and Scartaglen, County Kerry, Ireland.
In 2019 Kincardine, Ontario, held its fifth annual World Fiddle Day celebration with a downtown open air fiddling show.  The Scartaglen celebration that year included lectures about the lives of local fiddlers Denis Murphy and Julia Clifford.

GS2,De-hyphenation,"De-hyphenation is a form of foreign policy where a country keeps diplomatic ties with two or more countries with conflicting interests, without letting the conflicts prioritize one country over another. The policy allows countries to hold independent relations with countries otherwise distrustful or hostile towards each other while treating each country as a single entity rather than as a part of a conflict with the other countries.

Etymology
The term de-hyphenation refers to removing the ""hyphen"" that links two entities. In the context of foreign policy, it signifies the act of untangling or disentangling the relationships between two countries or regions that were previously considered together or linked in some way. By using the term ""de-hyphenation,"" it emphasizes the need to treat each entity independently and distinctly, rather than as a combined or interconnected unit. The word effectively captures the concept of breaking apart the previously linked foreign policy approach to allow for more tailored and individualized strategies towards each entity.

Examples of de-hyphenation
Indian de-hyphenation policy on Israel and Palestine
In 2014, the then newly elected Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, instituted the de-hyphenation policy towards Israel. The aim behind the policy was to form diplomatic ties with Israel independent from the diplomatic ties India shall have with Palestine.
On 15 January 2018, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited New Delhi to sign agreements on cooperation in the areas of cyber-defence, security and science. The visit took place one month after India had voted in favor of a resolution brought by Turkey and Yemen in the United Nations to oppose a decision made by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision that was strongly against Palestinian interests. Addressing the resolution, Netanyahu stated, ""I don't think one vote affects the general trend and you can see it in many oth"
GS2,Principle of consent,"Principle of consent is a term used in the context of the Northern Ireland peace process and is one of the key points of the Good Friday Agreement. The principle asserts both the legitimacy of the aspiration to a United Ireland and the legitimacy of the wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. The doctrine also asserts the right of self-determination for the people of both jurisdictions in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, without external interference, and only with the consensus of a majority of people in both polities. 
The principle of consent is now accepted by all elected parties in Ireland. It is opposed by Republican Sinn Féin, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, Éirígí and many non-aligned Irish republicans. 
Article 1 (ii) of the Good Friday Agreement says that the participants

recognise that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.""

It allows G.hn devices to coexist with other devices implementing G.9972 and operating on the same power line wiring.
G.9972 received consent during the meeting of ITU-T Study Group 15, on October 9, 2009, and final approval on June 11, 2010.
G.9972 specifies two mechanisms for coexistence between G.hn home networks and broadband over power lines (BPL) Internet access networks:

Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), in which the available spectrum is divided into two parts: frequencies below 10 or 14 MHz (specific value can be selected by the access network) are reserved for the access network, while frequencies above them are reserved for the in-home network.
Time-division multiplexing (TDM), in which the available channel time is split equally between both networks. 50% of time slots are allocated for the access network, and 50% are allocated to the in-home network.

GS2,Blocking statute,"A blocking statute is a law of one jurisdiction intended to hinder application there of a law made by a foreign jurisdiction. A blocking statute was proposed by the European Union in 1996 to nullify a US trade embargo on Cuba and sanctions related to Iran and Libya which affected countries trading with the US and with the named countries. The 1996 statute was not enacted as the disagreements were settled by other means.
A blocking statute shields companies in its jurisdiction against sanctions by prohibiting them from respecting the sanctions, and not recognising foreign court rulings enforcing them.

European Union blocking statute
A EU blocking statute was originally enacted in 1996 to ""counteract"" the sanctions imposed by the United States against Cuba, Iran and Libya.
After the US reimposed sanctions against Iran following its withdrawal from an agreement which permitted trade if Iran curtailed its nuclear programme, on 17 May 2018 the European Commission announced its intention to implement the blocking statute of 1996 to declare the US sanctions against Iran null and void in Europe and ban European citizens and companies from complying with them. The commission also instructed the European Investment Bank to facilitate European companies' investment in Iran.

2018 update
On 7 August 2018, the EU updated its blocking statute. The process of updating the EU blocking statute commenced by adding to its scope on 6 June 2018 the extraterritorial sanctions the US re-imposed on Iran. The European Commission said:

...We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran, in accordance with EU law and with UN Security Council resolution 2231... This is why the European Union’s updated Blocking Statute enters into force on 7 August to protect EU companies doing legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extra-territorial sanctions.
The 2018 blocking statute essentially prohibits EU companies from ""direct"" or ""indirect"
GS2,Illicit financial flows,"Illicit financial flows, in economics, are a form of illegal capital flight that occurs when money is illegally earned, transferred, or spent. This money is intended to disappear from any record in the country of origin, and earnings on the stock of illicit financial flows outside a country generally do not return to the country of origin.
Illicit financial flows can be generated in a variety of ways that are not revealed in national accounts or balance of payments figures, including trade mispricing, bulk cash movements, hawala transactions, and smuggling.
There are several economic models used to provide estimates of illicit financial flows and capital flight. The two most common methods are the World Bank Residual Model and the DOTS-based Trade Mispricing Model, which uses the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) database to analyze discrepancies in trade statistics between partner countries.  Another way to estimate trade mispricing is with the IPPS-based model, which was developed by John Zdanowicz of Florida International University. This method uses individual import and export transactions of the United States with the rest of the world to find inconsistencies in export and import prices. Economists also use hot money (Narrow) Method and the Dooley Method in these estimates.
A 2013 paper, authorized by Raymond W. Baker, Director of the Global Financial Integrity estimated illicit financial flows ""out of developing countries are approximately $1 trillion a year"". This study also found that China, Russia, and Mexico accounted for the three largest shares of worldwide illicit financial flows.
The  United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 has a target to significantly reduce illicit financial flows and strengthen recovery and return of stolen assets by 2030.

GS2,Barbary corsairs,"The Barbary corsairs, Barbary pirates, Ottoman corsairs, or naval mujahideen (in Muslim sources) were mainly Muslim corsairs and privateers who operated from the largely independent Barbary states. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary Coast, in reference to the Berbers. Slaves in Barbary could be of many ethnicities, and of many different religions, such as Christian, Jewish, or Muslim. Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along West Africa's Atlantic seaboard and into the North Atlantic as far north as Iceland, but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing merchant ships, they engaged in razzias, raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in the British Isles, and Iceland.
While such raids began after the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the 710s, the terms ""Barbary pirates"" and ""Barbary corsairs"" are normally applied to the raiders active from the 16th century onwards, when the frequency and range of the slavers' attacks increased. In that period, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the Barbary states. Similar raids were undertaken from Salé (see Salé Rovers) and other ports in Morocco.
Barbary corsairs captured thousands of merchant ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns in Europe.  As a result, residents abandoned their former villages on long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy.
The raids were such a problem that coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th century. Between 1580 and 1680, corsairs were said to have captured about 850,000 people as slaves and from 1530 to 1780 as many as 1.25 million people were enslaved. However, these numbers are estimated and provided by only one historian, Robert Davis, and have been questioned by others like David Earle. Some of these corsairs were Euro"
GS2,Cosmopolitan democracy,"Cosmopolitan democracy is a political theory which explores the application of norms and values of democracy at the transnational and global sphere. It argues that global governance of the people, by the people, for the people is possible and needed. Writers advocating cosmopolitan democracy include Immanuel Kant, David Held, Daniele Archibugi, Richard Falk, and Mary Kaldor.
In the cosmopolitan democracy model, decisions are made by those affected, avoiding a single hierarchical form of authority. According to the nature of the issues at stake, democratic practice should be reinvented to take into account the will of stakeholders. This can be done either through direct participation or through elected representatives. The model advocated by cosmopolitan democrats is confederal and decentralized—global governance without world government—unlike those models of global governance supported by classic World Federalism thinkers, such as Albert Einstein.
In 2021, a global citizen's assembly was organised to coincide with COP26 in Glasgow in October–November 2021. This is the first body that can claim to democratically represent the wishes of the global population.

Origin and development
The victory of Western liberal states ending the Cold War inspired the hope that international relations could be guided by the ideals of democracy and the rule of law. In the early 1990s, a group of thinkers developed the political project of cosmopolitan democracy with the aim of providing intellectual arguments in favour of an expansion of democracy, both within states and at the global level. While some significant successes have been achieved in terms of democratization within states, much less has been attained in democratizing the global system.
In different forms, the necessity to expand democratic procedures beyond the nation-state has been supported by political philosopher Jürgen Habermas, and sociologist Ulrich Beck.
Criticisms of cosmopolitan democracy have come from realist,"
GS2,Swiss People's Party,"The Swiss People's Party (German: Schweizerische Volkspartei, SVP; Romansh: Partida populara Svizra, PPS), also known as the Democratic Union of the Centre (French: Union démocratique du centre, UDC; Italian: Unione Democratica di Centro, UDC), is a national-conservative and right-wing populist political party in Switzerland. Chaired by Marcel Dettling, it is the largest party in the Federal Assembly, with 62 members of the National Council and 6 of the Council of States.
The SVP originated in 1971 as a merger of the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB) and the Democratic Party, while the BGB, in turn, had been founded in the context of the emerging local farmers' parties in the late 1910s. The SVP initially did not enjoy any increased support beyond that of the BGB, retaining around 11% of the vote through the 1970s and 1980s. This changed however during the 1990s, when the party underwent deep structural and ideological changes under the influence of Christoph Blocher; the SVP then became the strongest party in Switzerland by the 2000s.
In line with the changes fostered by Blocher, the party started to focus increasingly on issues such as Euroscepticism and opposition to mass immigration. Its vote share of 28.9% in the 2007 federal election was the highest vote ever recorded for a single party in Switzerland until 2015, when it surpassed its own record with 29.4%. Blocher's failure to win re-election as a Federal Councillor led to moderates within the party splitting to form the Conservative Democratic Party (BDP), which later merged with the Christian Democratic People's Party into The Centre. As of 2024, the party is the largest in the National Council with 62 seats. It has six seats in the Council of States.

The early origins of the SVP go back to the late 1910s, when numerous cantonal farmers' parties were founded in agrarian, Protestant, German-speaking parts of Switzerland. While the Free Democratic Party had"
GS2,Jus de non evocando,"Jus de non evocando is an ancient feudal right stating that no one can be kept from the competent court. It derives from a medieval principle that subjects of the Crown were entitled to ius de non evocando, the right to enjoy the jurisdiction and the protection of the Crown to which they were loyal. As such, it is still present in several constitutions, such as the German constitution, the Italian constitution and the Dutch constitution.
It has today become an important concept in public international law by which states refuse to extradite their own citizens. Some countries may refuse to extradite non-nationals, who because of their crimes may be subject to the death penalty. That may be seen in the case of Canada and Mexico towards the United States.
The principle is frequently argued in cases of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The foundation lies in that the international tribunal, by seizing jurisdiction over an international criminal trial from national courts, violates the principle of jus de non evocando. The Trial Chamber, in the case of Dusko Tadic (IT-94-1 of the ICTY), stated that states give up some measure of sovereignty to be a part of the UN, which produced the ICTY, and so there is no violation.

GS2,2010 Nuclear Security Summit,"The 2010 Nuclear Security Summit was a summit held in Washington, D.C., on April 12 and 13, 2010. The Summit focused on how to better safeguard weapons-grade plutonium and uranium to prevent nuclear terrorism.

Overview
The New START treaty was signed on April 8, 2010, in Prague by United States President Barack Obama and President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev.  After this summit, Iran hosted its own conference, International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, on April 17–18 (see below).  Then in May 2010, the 2010 review conference for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was held at United Nations headquarters in New York.

Background
With the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear weapons existing within the former Soviet territory became a concern. There was a priority in disarming the remaining weapons, as well as reducing the number of development facilities and materials. Following the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the possibility of terrorists misusing nuclear materials and facilities became a real threat, and nuclear security was highlighted as a means to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism.
On April 5, 2009, in Prague, U.S. President Barack Obama had presented a three-part strategy to address the international nuclear threat. The strategy consisted 1.) proposing measures to reduce and eventually eliminate existing nuclear arsenals; 2.) strengthening the Non-proliferation Treaty and halting proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional states; and 3.) preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials. The President stated in his Prague speech that nuclear terrorism is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security. He announced an international effort to secure vulnerable nuclear materials within four years, break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt illicit trade in nuclear materials. In the 2009 L'Aquila Summit held in Italy Obama formally an"
GS2,Cadena nacional,"In several Latin American countries, a cadena nacional (Spanish for 'national network'; plural cadenas nacionales), also referred to as a cadena oficial (Spanish for 'official network') or red voluntaria (Spanish for 'voluntary network'), is a joint broadcast, over various media (usually radio and television), directed at the general population of a state. Initially conceived as a form of emergency population warning, these broadcasts are often of a political nature, as most of them are messages by governmental authorities about various topics of general interest.
Depending on the country, the characteristics of cadenas nacionales vary. In some countries, they are enshrined in law; in others, they are informal and cooperative. In some countries, including Argentina and Venezuela, all stations are mandated to air these messages (similar in nature to Emergency Action Notifications in the United States).

Cadenas nacionales by Latin American country
Argentina
The use of cadenas nacionales in Argentina is regulated by Article 75 of the Law 26,522 of Audiovisual Communications Services, signed into law in 2008. This article specifies that the executive branch of the national government or of provincial governments may, in exceptional circumstances, use all of the broadcast stations in a state. When such a message is delivered, all Argentine television stations must cease all programming to allow for the broadcasting of the message. Article 74 of the same law requires broadcasters to make airtime available to political parties according to the electoral law.
Article 75 of Law 26,522 superseded the Decree-Law 22,285 of 1980, the National Broadcasting Law, which similarly required broadcasters to carry cadenas nacionales as defined by COMFER, the predecessor to today's ENACOM.

GS2,Moldovan neutrality,"Moldova is officially a neutral country. Neutrality is enshrined by Article 11 of the 1994 Constitution of Moldova. Adopted following Moldova's defeat in the Transnistria War in 1992, neutrality enjoys widespread support among the Moldovan population. Moldova together with Turkmenistan are the only post-Soviet states that declared neutrality after independence.

History and analysis
Neutrality is enshrined in the 1994 Constitution of Moldova. Article 11 states ""the Republic of Moldova proclaims its permanent neutrality"" and ""the Republic of Moldova does not accept the presence of any foreign military troops on its territory"". Furthermore, Article 142 states that neutrality, among other issues, can only be revised through a referendum. Earlier, the 1990 sovereignty declaration of the Moldavian SSR within the Soviet Union called for the demilitarization of Moldova in the context of the need of the withdrawal of the Soviet Armed Forces from the republic, with this call being renewed in Moldova's 1991 Declaration of Independence. Moldova and Turkmenistan are the only among the post-Soviet states that declared neutrality after their independence.
Moldovan historian Gheorghe E. Cojocaru stated in 2022 that the adoption of neutrality was a consequence of the Moldovan defeat in the Transnistria War in 1992. This would have had the objectives of helping overcome the consequences of the war, maintain an internal political balance and remain at an equal distance between the main geopolitical actors of the region. Cojocaru stated that the impact that Moldova's neutrality has had so far could be analyzed from two aspects, these being that neutrality had ensured that Moldova resisted all attempts of getting it involved into military collaboration projects in the region and that the policy had not been respected in the face of continued Russian military presence in Transnistria.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused reconsiderations in Moldova regarding its neutral status"
GS2,Timeline of al-Qaeda attacks,"The following is a list of attacks which have been carried out by Al-Qaeda.

1990s
1992
On December 29, 1992, the first attack by Al-Qaeda was carried out in Aden, Yemen, known as the 1992 Aden hotel bombings. That evening, a bomb went off at the Gold Mohur hotel, where U.S. troops had been staying while en route to Somalia, though the troops had already left when the bomb exploded.  The bombers targeted a second hotel, the Aden Movenpick, where they believed American troops might also be staying. That bomb detonated prematurely in the hotel car park, around the same time as the other bomb explosion, killing an Austrian tourist and a Yemeni citizen.  Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attack in 1998.

1993
On February 26, 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed for the first time. A bomb built in Jersey City was driven into an underground garage of the World Trade Center. The blast killed six people and injured over 1,000 others. The attack was not an official al-Qaeda operation, though the attack's mastermind, Ramzi Yousef, had trained in al-Qaeda camps. Osama bin Laden was never charged for the attack.

1995
On November 13, 1995, a car bomb exploded at a facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. military was training Saudi National Guardsmen. Five Americans and two Indians were killed and 60 people were wounded. The attack has been credited to al-Qaeda by the government of Saudi Arabia although Osama bin Laden never took credit for the bombing.

1998
In August 1998, Al-Qaeda operatives carried out the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people and injuring more than 5,000 others.

2000s
2000
Al-Qaeda planned to attack USS The Sullivans on January 3, 2000, but the effort failed due to too much weight being put on the small boat meant to bomb the ship.
Despite the setback with USS The Sullivans, al-Qaeda succeeded in bombing a U.S. Navy warship in October 2000 with the USS Cole bombing, killin"
GS2,Daniele Archibugi,"Daniele Archibugi (born 17 July 1958 in Rome, Italy) is an Italian economic and political theorist. He works on the economics and policy of innovation and technological change, on the political theory of international relations and on political and technological globalisation.

Biography
Archibugi graduated with an Economics degree at the University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" with Federico Caffè, and obtained a D.Phil. degree at SPRU of the University of Sussex under the mentorship of Christopher Freeman and Keith Pavitt. He has worked and taught at the Universities of Sussex, Naples, Cambridge, Sapienza University of Rome, LUISS University of Rome, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto and SWEFE University, Chengdu. He was Leverhulme Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics, and Lauro de Bosis Visiting Professor at Harvard University. In June 2006, Archibugi was appointed Honorary Professor at the University of Sussex. He currently works at the Italian National Research Council in Rome and at Birkbeck, University of London.

Cosmopolitan democracy
Together with David Held, Archibugi has been a key figure in the development of cosmopolitanism and of cosmopolitan democracy in particular, namely the attempt to apply some of the norms and values of democracy to global politics. He has advocated substantial reforms in international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union.
He has criticized the G7, G8 and G20 summits as undemocratic and urged for more transparent gathering for global politics. He has also taken position against a League of Democracies arguing that the same demands will be better served by a democratic reform of the United Nations. Archibugi is among the promoters of a directly elected World Parliament, and a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations.

GS2,Social fund,"A social fund (sometimes also called Social Investment Fund, Social Fund for Development, Social Action Fund, National Solidarity Fund or Social Development Agency) is an institution, typically in a developing country, that provides financing (usually grants) for small-scale public investments targeted at meeting the needs of poor and vulnerable communities. Social Funds also aim at contributing to social capital and development at the local level. In many cases they serve as innovators and demonstrators of new methods of decentralized participatory decision-making, management, and accountability that may be adopted for broader application by public sector organizations.

Prevalence
In 2007 Social Funds existed in more than 45 countries, predominantly in poorer and smaller developing countries that receive significant official development assistance. However, a Social Fund also exists in Romania, a country that has recently joined the EU, as well as in many other Eastern European countries. Probably the largest Social Fund is the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) with a resource base of US$ 500 million. Social Funds have channeled close to US$ 5 billion of World Bank funding in Africa alone between 1999 and 2005  and have channeled more than ten billion dollars from all donors and governments' own resources over the past 20 years.

History
The first Social Fund was created in 1987 in Bolivia. During the 1990s Social Funds spread quickly throughout Latin America and Africa with the intellectual and financial backing of the World Bank and other donors.
The first generation social funds were created to serve as short-term safety nets to soften the impact of structural adjustment policies on the poor, which was mainly achieved by providing temporary employment. Second generation social funds have adopted more explicit institutional strategies aimed at empowerment and capacity building of communities as well as local governments in the context of decentralization."

GS2,Global governance,"Global governance (or world governance) refers to institutions that coordinate the behavior of transnational actors, facilitate cooperation, resolve disputes, and alleviate collective action problems. Global governance broadly entails making, monitoring, and enforcing rules. Within global governance, a variety of types of actors – not just states – exercise power. 
In contrast to the traditional meaning of governance, the term global governance is used to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority. The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. 
The concept of global governance began in the mid-19th century. It became particularly prominent in the aftermath of World War I, and more so after the end of World War II. Since World War II, the number of international organizations has increased substantially. The number of actors (whether they be states, non-governmental organizations, firms, and epistemic communities) who are involved in governance relationships has also increased substantially.
Various terms have been used for the dynamics of global governance, such as complex interdependence, international regimes, multilevel governance, global constitutionalism, and ordered anarchy.
Stronger international cooperation is needed to tackle the interconnected global governance challenges such as health, trade, and the environment.

Definition
The term global governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. Global governance has also been defined as ""the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, rights and obligations are established, and differences are mediated"".

GS2,Trade in services,"Trade in Services refers to the sale and delivery of an intangible product, called a service, between a producer and consumer.  Trade in services that takes place between a producer and consumer that are, in legal terms, based in different countries is called International Trade in Services.

Methods of Trade
International trade in services is defined by the Four Modes of Supply of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).

(Mode 1) Cross-Border Trade – which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country, e.g. remotely providing accounting services in one country for a company based in another country, or an airline flying between two international destinations
(Mode 2) Consumption Abroad – this mode covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country, e.g. tourism, telemedicine, or study abroad
(Mode 3) Commercial Presence – which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country, e.g. a bank opening a physical branch or internet service provider offering internet services in another country
(Mode 4) Presence of Natural Persons – which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory of any other country, e.g. a business transferring an employee from one country to another for work duties (doctors or architects traveling and working abroad)
A ""natural person"" is a human being, as distinct from legal persons such as companies or organisations. Countries can freely decide where to liberalize on a sector-by-sector basis, including which specific mode of supply they want to cover for a given sector.
Mode 2 (Consumption Abroad) is by far the most liberalized mode in terms of commitments by WTO members. This is mostly due to governments being less likely to restrict the movements of citizens outside domestic borders (e.g. tourists). Mode 1 (Cross-Bord"
GS2,Tianxia,"Tianxia, 'all under Heaven', is a Chinese term for a historical Chinese cultural concept that denoted either the entire geographical world or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty. In ancient China and imperial China, tianxia denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Chinese sovereign by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Chinese court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Chinese court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common subjects, tributary states, and finally ending with fringe barbarians.
The center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese tianxia. In classical Chinese political thought, the ""Son of Heaven"", having received the Mandate of Heaven, would nominally be the ruler of the entire world. Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Chinese monarch, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Chinese monarch.
The larger concept of tianxia is closely associated with civilization and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the world view of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. Tianxia has been applied by other realms in the Sinosphere.

Historical development
The historical consensus is that a tianxia system existed at various points in Chinese history. Historical views differ, however, on exactly when it was in place. How a system of tianxia operated varied over time, ranging from vassal states accepted the authority of a Chinese emperor to when vassal states nominally paid tribute while in fact exercising thei"
GS2,Jus gentium,"In Roman law and legal traditions influenced by it, ius gentium or jus gentium (Latin for ""law of nations"" or ""law of peoples"") is the law that applies to all gentes (""peoples"" or ""nations""). It was an early form of international law, comprising not a body of statute law or legal code, but the customary law thought to be held in common by all in ""reasoned compliance with standards of international conduct"".
Ius gentium was regarded as a form of ius naturale, or natural law. Unlike ius civile, it applied to all persons and not only Roman citizens, as the rules of ius gentium could be derived from natural reason as innate in all of mankind.
Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, canon law also contributed to the European ius gentium. By the 16th century, the shared concept of the ius gentium disintegrated as individual European nations developed distinct bodies of law, the authority of the Pope declined, and colonialism created subject nations outside the West.

Roman law
In classical antiquity, the ius gentium was regarded as an aspect of natural law (ius naturale), as distinguished from civil law (ius civile). The jurist Gaius defined the ius gentium as what ""natural reason has established among all peoples"":

Every people (populus) that is governed by statutes and customs (leges et mores) observes partly its own peculiar law and partly the common law of all mankind. That law which a people established for itself is peculiar to it and is called ius civile (civil law) as being the special law of that civitas (state), while the law that natural reason establishes among all mankind is followed by all peoples alike, and is called ius gentium (law of nations, or law of the world) as being the law observed by all mankind. Thus the Roman people observes partly its own peculiar law and partly the common law of all mankind.
As a form of natural law, the ius gentium was regarded as ""innate in every human being"", a view that was consonant with Stoic philosophy. Ci"
GS2,Travel and Tourism Development Index,"The Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI), formerly known as the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), is an index developed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to measure the attractiveness and potential of countries for investment and development in the travel and tourism sector, rather than its attractiveness purely as a tourist destination. First published in 2007 under the title Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, the index was rebranded as the TTDI starting with the 2021 report.
The TTDI evaluates countries based on their performance across three main subindexes: regulatory framework; business environment and infrastructure; and human, cultural, and natural resources. Countries are scored on a scale from 1 to 6 in these categories, with the aggregated results forming the overall index.
In addition to rankings, the report includes detailed country profiles, featuring key indicators sourced from organizations such as the World Bank, the World Tourism Organization, and the World Travel and Tourism Council.

Variables
For the 2008 index, each of the three main subindexes is made of the scoring of the following 14 variables, called pillars in the TTC Report. Several changes were introduced in the 2008 TTCI in the definition of the variables as compared to the definitions of the 2007 TTCI.  First, the “environmental regulation” pillar was improved with help from the IUCN and the UNWTO, and for the 2008 index was renamed the “environmental sustainability” pillar to “better reflect its components and to capture the increasingly recognized importance of sustainability in the sector’s development.” Second, the original pillar “natural and cultural resources” was divided into two separate subcomponents: “natural resources” and “cultural resources”, thus, allowing to differentiate those countries which do not necessarily have the same strengths or weaknesses in these two different resources. In general, the model was improved with better data and new"
GS2,Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute,"There is an unresolved territorial dispute between the states of Belize (formerly known as British Honduras) and Guatemala, neighbours in Central America. During the late 1600s and throughout the 1700s, Britain and Spain signed several treaties regarding territories in the Americas. Both nations agreed that the territory of modern-day Belize was under Spanish sovereignty though British settlers could use the land, in specific areas and for specific purposes. The area was never fully under British or Spanish rule at this time and the British settlers continually expanded far past the boundaries set by the treaties. When the Spanish Empire fell, Guatemala said that it inherited Spain's sovereign rights over the territory. Since independence Guatemala has claimed, in whole or in part, the territory of Belize.
Guatemala and Britain negotiated the Wyke-Aycinena Treaty in 1859 regarding the disputed area. The treaty stated that Guatemala would recognise British sovereignty over the region and formed the modern-day boundary lines of Belize. The treaty also had an article about building a mutually beneficial road though it was never built. Shortly after this treaty the territory became a crown colony under British rule as British Honduras.
Throughout the 20th century, tensions flared up intermittently between Guatemala and British Honduras. A series of notes in 1931 were exchanged between Guatemala and the UK, confirming concrete markers implementing part of the 1859 border lines, showing that the treaty was being upheld by both parties at this point. Less than 10 years later, Guatemala renewed its claims on the area, using the broken promise of the road as justification for the 1859 treaty to be void. Britain stationed troops in British Honduras to secure the region against Guatemalan invasion and many negotiations attempting to resolve the dispute took place over the following decades. Belize and the British pursued a path to independence, eventually culminating in the Un"
GS2,Article 51 of the Constitution of India,"Article 51 of the Constitution of India is a directive principle of state policy enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution of India. It reflects India's commitment to international peace and cooperation, and outlines the guiding principles for the country's foreign policy objectives.

Background
On 29 November 1948, the Constituent Assembly debated the first version of Article 51 as Article 40 of the revised Draft Constitution, 1948. Draft Article 40 read:The State shall promote international peace and security by the prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations, by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among governments and by the maintenance of justice and respect for treaty obligations in the dealings of organised people with one another.

Part IV: Directive Principles of State Policy
Part IV of the Constitution of India contains the Directive Principles of State Policy. These principles are non-justiciable in nature, meaning they are not enforceable by the courts, but serve as guidelines for the government in making laws and policies. The Directive Principles aim to promote social justice, economic welfare, and the overall well-being of the citizens.

Article 51: Promotion of international peace and security
The State shall endeavour to—
(a) promote international peace and security;
(b) maintain just and honourable relations between nations;
(c) foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another; and
(d) encourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration.

Purpose
Article 51 of the Constitution of India, found within Part IV, emphasizes the importance of international peace and cooperation. It states that the State shall strive to foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the conduct of its affairs. Indirectly, this encourages the promotion of the principles of the United Nations Charter al"
GS2,Absolute gain (international relations),"According to the international relations theory of Liberalism, absolute gain is what international actors look at in determining their interests, weighing out the total effects of a decision on the state or organization and acting accordingly. The international actor's interests not only include power but also encompass the economic and cultural effects of an action as well. The theory is also interrelated with a non-zero-sum game which proposes that through use of comparative advantage, all states who engage in peaceful relations and trade can expand wealth.
This differs from Realist International Relations theories that employ relative gain, which seeks to describe the actions of states only in respect to power balances and without regard to other factors, such as economics. Relative gain is related to zero-sum game, which states that wealth cannot be expanded and the only way a state can become richer is to take wealth from another state.

GS2,Localisation (humanitarian practice),"Localisation (or localization) is the practice, in humanitarian aid, to give more decision making power and funding to organizations and people that are based in countries affected by humanitarian emergencies.
The tendency of humanitarian aid agencies to promote Europeans and North Americans into leadership roles, limits the number of leadership positions filled by people with first hand experience of living in an emergency.
The need to localise was agreed upon by governments and humanitarian organizations in 2016, at the World Humanitarian Summit meeting in Turkey. Localisation was promoted by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2017, as part of a wider series of reforms called the ""New Way of Working"".
A target to increase the percentage of global spending on humanitarian aid flowing directly to local organizations to 25% by 2020 was not reached.

Nomenclature
There is lack of consensus between humanitarian practitioners and scholars in defining localisation, with some believing that the definition should vary depending on the country and emergency.: 14 
Most commonly, localisation is understood to mean the practice, in humanitarian aid, of giving donor funding to aid agencies that are geographically located close to an emergency. The practice also includes increasing the number of people from communities affected by emergencies in senior leadership roles at humanitarian aid organizations.

Background
Humanitarian aid agencies tend to employ European and North Americans into senior leadership roles and tend to hire staff from countries more commonly affected by crises into more junior, local roles, blocking local staff from senior leadership roles. This tendency prevents people from local communities from influencing decision making about emergency responses to disasters.
Among humanitarian professionals, there is a widespread perception that increasing localisation will improve the quality of humanitarian aid. Despite the log"
GS2,Global Campaign on Military Spending,"The Global Campaign on Military Spending (GCOMS) is a global campaign that was created in December 2014 by the International Peace Bureau (IPB) to tackle the worldwide issue of excessive military spending. 
The aim of the campaign is to pressure the world's governments to invest money in the sectors of health, education, employment and climate change rather than military. It also calls for an annual, minimum reallocation of 10% from the military budgets of all states. Finally, it advocates the reduction of arms production and international weapons trade. 
The campaign organises the Global Day of Action on Military Spending (GDAMS) to bring public, media and political attention to the costs of military spending and the need to invest in new priorities.

GS2,Treaty,"A treaty is a formal, legally binding written agreement between sovereign states and/or international organizations that is governed by international law. A treaty may also be known as an international agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms; however, only documents that are legally binding on the parties are considered treaties under international law. Treaties may be bilateral (between two countries) or multilateral (involving more than two countries). 
Treaties are among the earliest manifestations of international relations; the first known example is a border agreement between the Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma around 3100 BC. International agreements were used in some form by most major civilizations and became increasingly common and more sophisticated during the early modern era. The early 19th century saw developments in diplomacy, foreign policy, and international law reflected by the widespread use of treaties. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) codified these practices and established rules and guidelines for creating, amending, interpreting, and terminating treaties, and for resolving disputes and alleged breaches.
Treaties are roughly analogous to contracts in that they establish the rights and binding obligations of the parties. They vary in their obligations (the extent to which states are bound to the rules), precision (the extent to which the rules are unambiguous), and delegation (the extent to which third parties have authority to interpret, apply and make rules). Treaties can take many forms and govern a wide range of subject matters, such as security, trade, environment, and human rights; they may also be used to establish international institutions, such as the International Criminal Court and the United Nations, for which they often provide a governing framework. Treaties serve as primary sources of international law and have codified or established most interna"

GS2,Multi-level governance,"Multi-level (or multilevel) governance is a term used to describe the way power is spread vertically between levels of government and horizontally across multiple quasi-government and non-governmental organizations and actors. This situation develops because countries have multiple levels of government including local, regional, state, national or federal, and many other organisations with interests in policy decisions and outcomes. International governance operates based on multi-level governance principles. Multi-level governance can be distinguished from multi-level government which is when different levels of government share or transfer responsibility amongst each other. Whereas multi-level governance analyses the relationship of different state levels and interaction with different types of actors.'

Origins and significance of the concept of Multi-level governance
Multi-level governance is an approach in political science and public administration theory that originated from studies on European integration. Political scientists Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks developed the concept of multi-level governance in the early 1990s and have continuously been contributing to the research program in a series of articles (see Bibliography). Their theory resulted from the study of the new structures that were put in place by the EU (Maastricht Treaty) in 1992. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy. It ""illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority"".
Multi-level governance' is a recent concept, having first entered the lexicon of political science around fifteen years ago as comparativists became re-acquainted with European integration and discovered that authority was shifting not only from central states up to Europe, but also down to subnational authorities. The first efforts to understand this were descri"
GS2,Gernot Zippe,"Gernot Zippe (November 1917 – 7 May 2008) was an Austrian mechanical engineer and a nuclear physicist of German origin who is widely credited with leading the team which developed the Zippe-type centrifuge– a centrifuge machine for the enrichment and collection of uranium-235, during his time in the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons.: 47

Biography
Zippe was born in Warnsdorf which was then part of the Austria-Hungary in November 1917.: 54–55  The Zippe family later moved to Vienna which allowed him to attend the University of Vienna and earned his doctorate in mechanical engineering in 1939.: 54–55  Zippe had earlier interests in aeronautical engineering and was a civilian flight instructor in the German Luftwaffe; while he also filled a role as a researcher on radar and propellers.: 54–55

In Russia
During the World War II, Zippe was captured by the Red Army and held in Soviet custody in Prague until 1946 when the Soviet intelligence, the  NKVD, learned of his technical background and moved him to Russia to work on the isotope separation for the feasibility of the weapon-grade uranium.: 55  Zippe who had never worked on a centrifuge before took over the project but he worked Max Steenbeck on the feasibility of the machine with the provided Russian intelligence on the works of American Jesse Beams from the Manhattan Project.: 59  The project was carried out at the Institute A in Sukhumi and was being overseen by German physicist, Manfred von Ardenne, and directed by another German scientist Max Steenbeck, whose theoretical achievements Zippe used to successful deployment in 1950.: 59  
In 1952, Zippe was transferred to Saint Petersburg to continue his work on the efficiency with the Russian scientists, which he stayed until 1954.: 60–61  It was an standard practice by the captured German scientists to quarantine if they had work on the Soviet program of nuclear weapons, which Zippe did while being interned in transition camp in Kyiv.: 64

GS2,Multilateral treaty,"A multilateral treaty or multilateral agreement is a treaty to which two or more sovereign states are parties. Each party owes the same obligations to all other parties, except to the extent that they have stated reservations. Examples of multilateral treaties include the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Geneva Conventions, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

Relationship to bilateral treaties
A bilateral treaty is a treaty between two states. A bilateral treaty may become a multilateral treaty when additional new parties succeed or accede to it. Pope Francis argues in his encyclical letter Fratelli tutti (2020) that ""preference should be given to multilateral agreements between states, because, more than bilateral agreements, they guarantee the promotion of a truly universal common good and the protection of weaker states.

Plurilateral treaties
A plurilateral treaty is a special type of multilateral treaty. A plurilateral treaty is a treaty between a limited number of states with a particular interest in the subject of the treaty. The primary difference between a plurilateral treaty and other multilateral treaties is that the availability of reservations is more limited under a plurilateral treaty. Due to the limited nature of a plurilateral treaty, the full cooperation of the parties to the treaty is required in order for the object of the treaty to be met. As a result, reservations to plurilateral treaties are not allowed without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. This principle is codified in international law by article 20(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:

When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires ac"
GS2,Xinjiang Data Project,"The Xinjiang Data Project is a China-focused Australian research project created and managed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). The project states that it has identified grave human rights violations in Xinjiang, including the mass detention of minorities, and compulsory sterilizations. 
The researchers found that one out of every three mosques have been demolished in Xinjiang since 2017.

Launch and funding
The ASPI launched the Xinjiang Data Project in September 2020 as a part of its International Cyber Policy Centre. According to the project's website, initial funding for the project came from the United States Department of State.

Publication of information from Xinjiang
According to the project, satellite data has allowed it to locate ""380 suspected detention facilities"" in Xinjiang, and to estimate that 35 % of mosques in the region have been demolished, including a pilgrimage town, Ordam Mazar. The project says that it has also used interviews from former inmates to collect information. The project has promoted research by Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, who says that the Chinese government has embarked on a program of mass sterilization in Xinjiang.
According to the researchers, development in the region is being used as a ""facade for cultural erasure and desecration of religious sites.""
The Chinese government has responded that the camps are vocational training and re-education programs meant to alleviate poverty and counter terrorism.

GS2,Trade and development,"Trade can be a key factor in economic development. The prudent use of trade can boost a country's development and create absolute gains for the trading partners involved. Trade has been touted as an important tool in the path to development by prominent economists. However trade may not be a panacea for development as important questions surrounding how free trade really is and the harm trade can cause domestic infant industries to come into play.

Importance
The current consensus is that trade, development, and poverty reduction are intimately linked. Sustained economic growth over longer periods is associated with poverty reduction, while trade and growth are linked. Countries that develop invariably increase their integration with the global economy. while export-led growth has been , 
Continents, countries and sectors that have not developed and remain largely poor have comparative advantage in three main areas:

natural resource exploitation, i.e. running down of natural capital such as rain forest timber;
low-education labor-intensive manufacturing, due to high population densities and little suitable land per person;
agriculture, due to low population densities and relatively large areas of suitable land per person.
Crucially for poverty reduction, the latter two at least are labor-intensive, helping to ensure that growth in these sectors will be poverty-reducing. However, low value-added, price instability and sustainability in these commodity sectors means they should be used only temporarily and as stepping stones in the path to economic development.

GS2,World Constitutional Convention call,"The World Constitution Coordinating Committee (WCCC) was an international committee led by Thane Read to build widespread support for the development and establishment of a World constitution. It was officially established in 1962. It was formed to address the mounting concern over the threat of atomic war and the pressing need for global peace and cooperation via establishing a World Federation governed by mutually constituted world law.

History
The idea of holding a constitutional convention to develop a world constitution had been discussed and planned by various groups since the early 20th century.

Campaign for World Government
In 1937, the Campaign for World Government (CWG) was established to promote the idea of governments taking the initiative to organize a World Constitutional Convention. Despite introducing bills in various parliaments, tangible support for the convention did not materialize.

Peoples' World Convention
In a similar vein, the Henry Usborne's ""Peoples' World Convention Plan"" was launched, garnering approval from notable personalities like Albert Einstein, Boyd-Orr, Radhakrishnan, Albert Camus, Jacques Maritain, and Thomas Mann. This plan aimed to secure democratic elections in every country for delegates to a world convention. Although the plans were successful in 1950-51, no work was done for the development of the world constitution. It was decided that work on the world constitution would be carried out in upcoming world constituent assemblies.

Thane Read, WCCC and World Constitutional Convention call
In year 1958, Thane Read, an independent U.S. economist, began cultivating a joint appeal by renowned individuals from around the world, which culminated in the issuance of the ""Call to all nations"". The Call urged nations to send delegates to Geneva to a world convention to draft a constitution for a democratic federal World Government. The proposed constitution would then be submitted to all nations for ratification, leading to the esta"
GS2,Cobdenism,"Cobdenism is an economic ideology (and the associated popular movement) which perceives international free trade and a non-interventionist foreign policy as the key requirements for prosperity and world peace. It is named after the British statesman and economist Richard Cobden and had its heyday of political influence in the British Empire during the mid-19th century, amidst and after the endeavour to abolish the Corn Laws.
Based on Adam Smith's assertion that full employment and economic growth require access to foreign markets, Cobden perceived the expansion of foreign trade as the main means of increasing global prosperity and emphasized the importance of the international division of labour for economic progress. Akin to his ideal of Britain as an industrial society of small cooperating property owners, he believed in an international order of small, independent nations attaining shared prosperity through international trade. As Cobden saw Britain's involvement in empire as an unwelcome distraction of domestic investment into its industrial capacity, his writings became influential in anti-imperialist circles, being picked up by e.g. John A. Hobson. Moreover, it influenced the economic thinking of John Maynard Keynes, who was a staunch adherent of Richard Cobden's theories prior to the First World War, after which he abandoned Cobdenism in favor of ""insular capitalism"".
Rarely used today and already in decline by the end of the 19th century, Cobdenism was revived by some academics during the 1980s to support the liberalization of the British economy.

GS2,Smiling Buddha,"Smiling Buddha (MEA designation: Pokhran-I) was the code name of India's first successful nuclear weapon test on 18 May 1974. The nuclear fission bomb was detonated in the Pokhran Test Range of the Indian Army in Rajasthan. As per the United States military intelligence, the operation was named as Happy Krishna. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) described the test as a peaceful nuclear explosion. 
The bomb was built by scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) headed by Raja Ramanna, in assistance with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) headed by B. D. Nag Chaudhuri under the supervision of the Atomic Energy Commission headed by Homi Sethna. A CIRUS nuclear reactor given by Canada and heavy water (used as a neutron moderator) supplied by the United States were used in the production of nuclear material for the bomb. The preparations for the test and the detonation was conducted in extreme secrecy with very few people outside the team of scientists being aware of the test. 
The device was of the implosion-type design with a plutonium core. It had a hexagonal cross section, 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in) in diameter, and weighed 1,400 kg (3,100 lb). It was assembled, mounted on a hexagonal metal tripod, and was transported to the test site on rails. The test was conducted at 8.05 IST on 18 May 1974. The data on the exact nuclear yield of the test has been varied and scarce, and sources indicate that the bomb might have yielded between six and ten kilotons.
It was the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The test led to the formation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to control nuclear proliferation. After the test, India carried out one other nuclear test named Pokhran-II in 1998.

Background

GS2,Foreign relations of the European Union,"Although there has been a large degree of integration between European Union member states, foreign relations is still a largely intergovernmental matter, with the 27 states controlling their own relations to a large degree. However, with the Union holding more weight as a single entity, there are at times attempts to speak with one voice, notably on trade and energy matters. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy personifies this role.

Policy and actors
The EU's foreign relations are dealt with either through the Common Foreign and Security Policy decided by the European Council, or the economic trade negotiations handled by the European Commission. The leading EU diplomat in both areas is the High Representative Kaja Kallas.   The council can issue negotiating directives (not to be confused with directives, which are legal acts) to the Commission giving parameters for trade negotiations.
A limited amount of defence co-operation takes place within the Common Security and Defence Policy, as well as in programmes coordinated by the European Defence Agency and the Commission through the Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space. A particular element of this in the Union's foreign relations is the use of the European Peace Facility, which can finance the common costs CSDP missions in third states or assistance measures for third states.

Diplomatic representation
History
The High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the EU's predecessor, opened its first mission in London in 1955, three years after non-EU countries began to accredit their missions in Brussels to the Community. The US had been a fervent supporter of the ECSC's efforts from the beginning, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson sent Jean Monnet a dispatch in the name of President Truman confirming full US diplomatic recognition of the ECSC. A US ambassador to the ECSC was accredited soon thereafter, and he headed the second overseas missio"
GS2,Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation,"The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC), formed in 2012, is an association of governments and organisations that seeks to improve practices of international development. It has a unique position due to the breadth and stature of its participants (in 2021 about 161 countries and 56 major organisations concerned with development).
The creation of GPEDC was mandated by the 2011 Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, the fourth and last in a series of such forums held between 2003 and 2011. The purpose was to carry forward an ""effective development co-operation"" agenda, superseding the previous ""aid effectiveness"" movement. After the creation of the international Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, GPEDC aligned its mandate to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. GPEDC's monitoring exercises in 2016 and 2018 showed mixed success in advancing its endorsed practices of effective development co-operation. A notable disappointment has been lack of full participation by China and India.

Organisation
Participants
GPEDC does not have a formal membership system but says (as of 2021) it ""brings together 161 countries and 56 organizations"".

Governance
GPEDC's key governance institutions are: a Steering Committee which meets twice a year; a Joint Support Group, hosted jointly by OECD and UNDP, which carries on GPEDC work between meetings of the Steering Committee; four Co-Chairs who chair the Steering Committee and provide guidance the JSG; and periodic High-Level Meetings where representatives of all primary stakeholders can take part.

Funding
Funding for the administration of GPEDC has been provided by at least 20 governments.

Vision
The stated vision of GPEDC is: ""to maximise the effectiveness of all forms of co-operation for development for the shared benefits of people, planet, prosperity and peace"".

Principles
GPEDC espouses four principles for development co-operation:

GS2,His Majesty's Diplomatic Service,"His Majesty's Diplomatic Service (HMDS) is the diplomatic service of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, dealing with foreign affairs and representing British interests overseas, as opposed to the Home Civil Service, which deals with domestic affairs. It employs around 14,000 people, roughly one-third of whom are crown servants working directly for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, either in London or abroad. The remaining two-thirds are employed locally by one of nearly 270 British diplomatic missions abroad (such as embassies, consulates and high commissions). The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is also the Head of the Diplomatic Service.
Entry into the Diplomatic Service is highly competitive. In 2018, 12,266 applicants sought to join the Diplomatic Service fast stream. Seventy-one were successful, representing 0.6% of those who applied. This compares to the general civil service fast stream, also highly competitive, in which 9.1% of candidates were successful. Until around 2009 members of the Diplomatic Service could also formally receive a Royal Commission, signed by the Foreign Secretary and by the monarch, as members of a Crown service.
The Foreign Service, which originally provided civil servants to staff the Foreign Office, was once a separate service, but it amalgamated with the Diplomatic Service in 1918. The Diplomatic Service also absorbed the Colonial Service in the late 1960s.
Women were not allowed to join the Diplomatic Service until 1946. In 1936, an advisory committee on allowing women into the diplomatic service concluded that the admission of women would harm the service (the female members of the committee disagreed). Until 1973, they were required to leave when they married. The first female ambassador to be appointed was Barbara Salt, to Israel in 1962, but ill-health prevented her from taking up the post.

GS2,Anti-Palestinianism,"This page is subject to the extended confirmed restriction related to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Anti-Palestinianism or anti-Palestinian racism refers to prejudice, collective hatred, and discrimination directed at the Palestinian people for any variety of reasons. Since the mid-20th century, the phenomenon has largely overlapped with anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia because the overwhelming majority of Palestinians today are Arabs and Muslims. Historically, anti-Palestinianism was more closely identified with European antisemitism, as far-right Europeans detested the Jewish people as undesirable foreigners from Palestine. Modern anti-Palestinianism—that is, xenophobia or racism towards the Arabs of Palestine—is most common in Israel, the United States, Lebanon, and Germany, among other countries.
Anti-Palestinian racism includes ""erasing the human rights and equal dignity and worth of Palestinians""; defending acts of violence against Palestinians; and refusing ""to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people with a collective identity"". Pakistani author and professor Sunaina Maira, citing American professor of Islamic studies Shahzad Bashir in the context of labelling, states: ""...an important aspect of anti-Palestinianism, that is, the moral panic whipped up about the 'radicalization' of Muslim and Arab American youth is often accompanied by the charge that they are automatically anti-Semites if they are critical of the Israeli state's policies."" According to Moustafa Bayoumi, anti-Palestinianism preceded the modern wave of Islamophobia and influenced the rise of the latter.

In 2018, author and political activist Yves Engler criticized the New Democratic Party (NDP) for its conduct in respect of the Palestine Resolution that called for support of efforts to ban ""settlement products from Canadian markets, and using other forms of diplomatic and economic pressure to end the [Israeli] occupation.""

GS2,Summer solstice,"The summer solstice or estival solstice occurs when one of Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). The summer solstice is the day with the longest  period of daylight and shortest night of the year in that hemisphere, when the sun is at its highest position in the sky. At either pole there is continuous daylight at the time of its summer solstice. The opposite event is the winter solstice.
The summer solstice occurs during the hemisphere's summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is the June solstice (20, 21 or 22 June) and in the Southern Hemisphere, this is the December solstice (20, 21, 22 or 23 of December). Since prehistory, the summer solstice has been a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals. Traditionally, in temperate regions (especially Europe), the summer solstice is seen as the middle of summer and referred to as midsummer; although today in some countries and calendars it is seen as the beginning of summer.
On the summer solstice, Earth's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44°. Likewise, the Sun's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44°. In areas outside the tropics, the sun reaches its highest elevation angle at solar noon on the summer solstice.

Although the summer solstice is the longest day of the year for that hemisphere, the dates of earliest sunrise and latest sunset vary by a few days. This is because Earth orbits the Sun in an ellipse, and its orbital speed varies slightly during the year.

Culture
There is evidence that the summer solstice has been culturally important since the Neolithic era. Many ancient monuments in Europe especially, as well as parts of the Middle East, Asia and the Americas, are aligned with the sunrise or sunset on the summer solstice (see archaeoastronomy). The significance of the summer solstice has varied among cultures, but most recognize the event in some way with holid"
GS2,Transatlantic studies,"Transatlantic studies refers to the relatively recent educational discipline studying the economic, cultural, political, and social linkages between Atlantic countries, often the United States and Europe. The scholarly tendency has been critiqued as an iteration of Eurocentrism, as Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera notes in ""Transatlantic Approaches"": ""Engaging prefixes like multi-and trans-as a method to shift attention toward intellectual duality—that is, imagined connections between imagined communities—often repeats the marginalization of traditionally silenced peoples. We might describe the field of African, American, and European tracts as dedicated to a horizontalized cultural history—its fertilizations, exchanges, translations, contacts, and mixtures—but there is a looming danger of the subfields merging into an approach that results in the same dilemmas as other hyphens and prefixes.""

GS2,Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era,"Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) is a transnational feminist network of scholars, researchers and activists from the global South. DAWN works under the gender, ecology and economic justice (GEEJ) framework, which highlights the linkages between these three advocacy areas. The network offers a forum for feminist advocacy, research, and analysis on global social, political, and economic issues affecting women, with a focus on poor and marginalized women of the global South. This was a shift from the association of feminism with white, middle-class women of the global North common at the time of DAWN’s formation and into the present-day. Rafia Zakaria, author of Against White Feminism: Notes on Disruption, argues that DAWN and its empowerment approach to development offer a successful example of a bottom-up, antiracist alternative to political mobilization that decentres the whiteness prominent in dominant feminist development projects.

History
DAWN, which today has its Secretariat based in Fiji, was founded in Bangalore, in 1984. The founding committee members were Neuma Aguiar (Brazil), Zubeida Ahmad (Pakistan), Peggy Antrobus (Barbados), Lourdes Arizpe (Mexico), Nirmala Banerjee (India), Carmen Barroso (Brazil), Ela Bhatt (India), Tone Bleie (Norway), Noeleen Heyzer (Malaysia), Hameeda Hossain (Bangladesh), Devaki Jain (India), Kumari Jayawardene (Sri Lanka), Isabel Larguia (Cuba), Ragnhild Lund (Norway), Geertje Lycklama (Netherlands), Lucille Mair (Jamaica), Katharine McKee (United States), Fatima Mernissi (Morocco), Achola Pala Okeyo (Kenya), Marie-Angelique Savane (Senegal), Gita Sen (India), and Claire Slatter (Fiji).

GS2,Integrated Conservation and Development Project,"Integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs), are biodiversity conservation projects with rural development components. It is an approach that aspires to combine social development with conservation goals. These projects look to deal with biodiversity conservation objectives through the use of socio-economic investment tools. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), first introduced ICDPs in the mid-1980s. They wanted to attend to some of the problems associated with the “fines and fences” (non-participatory) approach to conservation.

ICDPs under WWF
The Wildlands & Human Needs Program was initiated in 1985 by WWF, and incorporated 19 ICDPs in 12 countries in Africa and South America. They wanted to improve the quality of life of rural people through projects that integrated the management of natural resources with economic development. Today, there are around 300 ICDPs.

Various names of ICDPs
ICDPs have many different names, like “People-Centered Conservation and Development”, “Eco-development”, “grassroots conservation”, community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), and community wildlife management (CWM), all of which were created by the conservation organizations, rather than the indigenous people.

Characteristics of ICDPs
Biodiversity conservation is the primary goal, but ICDPs also like to deal with the social and economic requirements of communities who might threaten biodiversity. They wish to improve the relationships between state-managed protected areas and their neighbors, but do not inevitably seek to delegate ownership of protected area resources to local communities. They usually receive funding from external sources and are externally motivated and initiated by conservation organizations and development agencies. ICDPs are normally linked to a protected area, usually a national park. ICDPs, through benefit sharing, are believed to discourage poaching and promote economic development. ICDPs try to benefit indigenous populations in s"

The Government of Serbia does not diplomatically recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state, although the two countries have enjoyed normalised economic relations since 2020 and have agreed not to try to interfere with the other's accession to the European Union.
As of 4 September 2020, 104 out of 193 (53.9%) United Nations member states, 22 out of 27 (81.5%) European Union member states, 28 out of 32 (87.5%) NATO member states, 4 out of 10 (40%) ASEAN member states, and 34 out of 57 (59.6%) Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member states have recognised Kosovo. In total, Kosovo received 114 diplomatic recognitions by UN member states, however conflicts have arisen regarding the exact number of countries recognizing Kosovo. Among the G20 countries, eleven (including all seven G7 countries) have recognised Kosovo as an independent state: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Eight (including all five founding BRICS countries), however, have not: Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa.
In 2013, the two sides began to normalise relations in accordance with the Brussels Agreement. In September 2020, Serbia and Kosovo agreed to normalise economic ties. Serbia also agreed to suspend its efforts to encourage other states to either not recognise Kosovo or to revoke recognition for one year, while Kosovo agreed to not apply for new membership of international organisations for the same period.

GS2,Education Freedom Day,"Education Freedom Day (EFD) is an international event launched by the Digital Freedom Foundation in 2013. It's annually observed on March 21. It is similar to other Freedom Days, namely Software, Hardware and Culture Freedom Day. The goal of EDF is spread knowledge and awareness regarding the benefits of using free software and free educational resources for education.

History
The first Education Freedom Day was observed on January 17, 2013. The date, however, had to later be changed due to incompatibilities with local holidays such as Chinese New Year and summer holidays when schools are closed. Presently it is observed in March. In 2016, EFD was observed on March 21.
Event organization is handled by DFF and volunteers around the world. Volunteers are encouraged to organize events that benefit local educational communities.

GS2,Berlin Nakroma,"Berlin Nakroma is a roll-on/roll-off passenger and cargo ferry owned and operated by the Government of East Timor since 2007.  A gift to East Timor from the Federal Republic of Germany, she links Dili, capital city of East Timor, with Pante Macassar in the East Timorese exclave of Oecusse, and with Atauro Island.

Concept and construction
The Democratic Republic of East Timor is made up of three main parts, being the eastern half of Timor, the exclave of Oecusse adjacent to the northwestern coast of Timor, and the island of Atauro.  Passport-free transport between these three locations is possible only by sea.
In 2002, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commissioned a cooperation project to improve East Timorese living conditions by establishing a regular maritime passenger and goods transport connection between the three locations.
From 2003 to 2006, a passenger ferry was chartered to operate such a connection.  During that period, around 3,400 passengers used the service each month.  In February 2007, a new ferry commissioned by the BMZ and financed by KfW Development Bank, the Nakroma, was officially handed over to the East Timorese government to assume the operation of the service.
The donated ferry was built in Surabaya, Indonesia, by PT PAL.   She is a roll-on/roll-off vessel 47.25 m (155.0 ft) long, and has a beam of 12 m (39 ft).  Her tonnage is 1,134 gross tonnage (GT) and 262 tons deadweight (DWT).  She can carry up to 300 passengers (20 in first class, 149 in second class forward, and 131 in second class aft), and up to 110 tonnes deadweight (DWT) of cargo.
In recognition of the success of the cooperation project, the ferry was renamed Berlin Nakroma.

Service history
Berlin Nakroma operates regular ferry services linking Dili with Pante Macassar in Oecusse, and with Atauro, using landing facilities in Dili and Oecusse that were upgraded as part of the cooperation project.

GS2,International Workers' Day,"International Workers' Day, also known as Labour Day in some countries and often referred to as May Day, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement and occurs every year on 1 May, or the first Monday in May.
Traditionally, 1 May is the date of the European spring festival of May Day. The International Workers Congress held in Paris in 1889 established the Second International for labor, socialist, and Marxist parties. It adopted a resolution for a ""great international demonstration"" in support of working-class demands for the eight-hour day. The 1 May date was chosen by the American Federation of Labor to commemorate a general strike in the United States, which had begun on 1 May 1886 and culminated in the Haymarket affair four days later. The demonstration subsequently became a yearly event. The 1904 Sixth Conference of the Second International, called on ""all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the eight-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace"".
The 1st of May, or first Monday in May, is a national public holiday in many countries, in most cases known as ""International Workers' Day"" or a similar name. Some countries celebrate a Labour Day on other dates significant to them, such as the United States and Canada, which celebrate Labor Day on the first Monday of September. In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated 1 May to ""Saint Joseph the Worker"". Saint Joseph is the patron saint of workers and craftsmen, among others.

Origin
Labor Celebration days existed in some European countries since the end of 18th century - sometimes on January 20 (France, 1793), sometimes on June 5 (France, 1867).
On 21 April 1856, Australian stonemasons in Victoria undertook a mass stoppage as part of the eight-hour workday movement. It became a yearly commemoration, inspiring A"
GS2,Pan-pan,"The radiotelephony message PAN-PAN is the international standard urgency signal that someone aboard a boat, ship, aircraft, or other vehicle uses to declare that they need help and that the situation is urgent, but for the time being, does not pose an immediate danger to anyone's life or to the vessel itself. This is referred to as a state of ""urgency"". This is distinct from a mayday call (distress signal), which means that there is imminent danger to life or to the continued viability of the vessel itself. Radioing ""pan-pan"" informs potential rescuers (including emergency services and other craft in the area) that an urgent problem exists, whereas ""mayday"" calls on them to drop all other activities and immediately begin a rescue.
The exact representation of PAN in Morse code is the urgency signal XXX ( ▄▄▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄  ▄▄▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄  ▄▄▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄ ), which was first defined by the International Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927.

Etymology
As with ""mayday"" (from venez m'aider, ""come help me""), the urgency signal pan-pan derives from French. In French, a panne [pan] is a breakdown, such as a mechanical failure. In English, it is sometimes pronounced as  PAHN and sometimes as  PAN.
A three-letter backronym, ""possible assistance needed"" or ""pay attention now"", derives from pan. Maritime and aeronautical radio communications courses use those as mnemonics to convey the important difference between mayday and pan-pan.

Usage
To declare pan-pan correctly, the caller repeats it three times: ""Pan-pan, pan-pan, pan-pan"", then states the intended recipient, either ""all stations, all stations, all stations"", or a specific station, e.g. ""Victoria Coast Guard Radio, Victoria Coast Guard Radio, Victoria Coast Guard Radio"". Then the caller states their craft's identification, position, nature of the problem, and the type of assistance or advice they require, if any.

The phrase ""PAN-PAN MEDICAL"" is reserved for medical transports. It is used to announce and identify me"
GS2,Divine right of kings,"Divine right of kings, divine right, or God's mandation, is a political and religious doctrine of political legitimacy of a monarchy in Western Christianity up until the Enlightenment. It is also known as the divine-right theory of kingship.
The doctrine asserts that a monarch is not accountable to any earthly authority (such as a parliament or the Pope) because their right to rule is derived from divine authority. Thus, the monarch is not subject to the will of the people, of the aristocracy, or of any other estate of the realm. It follows that only divine authority can judge a monarch, and that any attempt to depose, dethrone, resist or restrict their powers runs contrary to God's will and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It does not imply that their power is absolute.: 858 
In its full-fledged form, the Divine Right of Kings is associated with Henry VIII of England (and the Acts of Supremacy), James VI and I of Scotland and England, Louis XIV of France, and their successors.  
In contrast, the conception of human rights started being developed during the Middle Ages by scholars such as St. Thomas Aquinas (see Natural Law) and were systematised by the thinkers of the Age of Enlightenment, e.g. John Locke. Liberty, dignity, freedom and equality are examples of important human rights.

Concept
Divine right has been a key element of the self-legitimization of many absolute monarchies, connected with their authority and right to rule.  Related but distinct notions include Caesaropapism (the complete subordination of bishops etc. to the secular power), Supremacy (the legal sovereignty of the civil laws over the laws of the Church), Absolutism (a form of monarchical or despotic power that is unrestrained by all other institutions, such as churches, legislatures, or social elites) or Tyranny (an absolute ruler who is unrestrained even by moral law).   
Historically, many notions of rights have been authoritarian and hierarchical, with different people granted different"
GS2,Travel document,"A travel document is an identity document issued by a government or international entity pursuant to international agreements to enable individuals to clear border control measures. Travel documents usually assure other governments that the bearer may return to the issuing country, and are often issued in booklet form to allow other governments to place visas as well as entry and exit stamps into them.
The most common travel document is a passport, which usually gives the bearer more privileges like visa-free access to certain countries. While passports issued by governments are the most common variety of travel document, many states and international organisations issue other varieties of travel documents that allow the holder to travel internationally to countries that recognise the documents. For example, stateless persons are not normally issued a national passport, but may be able to obtain a refugee travel document or the earlier ""Nansen passport"" which enables them to travel to countries which recognise the document, and sometimes to return to the issuing country.
Border control policies typically require travellers to present valid travel documents in order to ascertain their identity, nationality or permanent residence status, and eligibility to enter a given jurisdiction. The most common form of travel document is the passport, a booklet-form identity document issued by national authorities or the governments of certain subnational territories containing an individual's personal information as well as space for the authorities of other jurisdictions to affix stamps, visas, or other permits authorising the bearer to enter, reside, or travel within their territory. Certain jurisdictions permit individuals to clear border controls using identity cards, which typically contain similar personal information.
Different countries impose varying travel document regulations and requirements as part of their border control policies and these may vary based on the tra"
GS2,Anti-Irish sentiment,"Anti-Irish sentiment, also Hibernophobia, is bigotry against the Irish people or individuals. It can include hatred, oppression, persecution, as well as simple discrimination. Generally, it could be bigotry against people from the island of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, or Northern Ireland. Specifically, it could be directed against Irish immigrants, or their descendants, throughout the world, who are known as the Irish diaspora.
It occurred in the Middle Ages, the Early Modern Age and the Age of Enlightenment. Also instances recorded during Irish immigration to Great Britain, North America, and Australia are notable. Anti-Irish sentiment can include internal conflict dealing with social, racial and cultural discrimination within Ireland itself. Sectarianism and cultural, religious or political conflicts are referred to as the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Perspective
Hostility increased towards the Irish over the centuries, as they steadfastly remained Roman Catholic despite the fact that Edward VI and subsequent rulers used coercion to convert them to Protestantism. The religious majority of the Irish nation was ruled by a religious minority, leading to perennial social conflict. During the Great Famine in the middle of the 19th century, some evangelical Protestants sought to convert the starving Catholics as part of their relief efforts.

History
Pre-Modern era
Negative English attitudes towards the Gaelic Irish and their culture date as far back as the reign of Henry II of England. In 1155, Pope Adrian IV (himself an Englishman) issued the papal bull called Laudabiliter, that gave Henry permission to conquer Ireland as a means of strengthening the Papacy's control over the Irish Church, although the very existence of the bull is disputed by modern historians. Pope Adrian called the Irish a ""rude and barbarous"" nation. The Norman invasion of Ireland began in 1169 with the backing of Pope Alexander III, who was Pope at the time of the invasion and ratified th"
GS2,United Nations special rapporteur,"Special rapporteur (or independent expert) is the title given to independent human rights experts whose expertise is called upon by the United Nations (UN) to report or advise on human rights from a thematic or country-specific perspective.
Depending on the specific mandate, there can also be working groups composed of an independent expert from each of the five UN regional groupings: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and the Western group. Their work falls within the scope of ""special procedure"" mechanisms under the United Nations Human Rights Council, and their contributions can advance human rights through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to improving access to redress, policy reform, mainstreaming human rights, raising human rights awareness, and acting to prevent or cease rights violations. 
The mandate by the United Nations has been to ""examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report"" on human rights problems through ""activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities.""

Appointment authority
Appointed by the Human Rights Council of the UN, these mandate-holders act independently of governments and as such play an important role in monitoring sovereign nations and democratically elected governments and policies. The earliest such appointment was the 1980 Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances responding to Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI). The first special rapporteur, responsible for monitoring extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, began work in 1982 following the approval of Commission on Human Rights Resolution 1982/35.

GS2,International Noble Gas Experiment,"The International Noble Gas Experiment (INGE) was formed in 1999 as an informal expert's group of developers of radioactive xenon measurement systems for the International Monitoring System for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) (signed in 1997, but which has not entered into force).  The group originally consisted of research and development groups from Germany, France, Russia, Sweden, and the United States, as well as personnel from Provisional Technical Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization CTBTO.
The INGE group was formed to test aspects of measuring xenon fission product radionuclides released by nuclear explosions.  The systems developed and participating in the INGE measure xenon isotopes in the atmosphere and includes 131mXe, 133Xe, 133mXe, and 135Xe.
Since the INGE was formed in 1999, the group has expanded somewhat and now includes R&D and operational groups from many locations around the world.  Although there is no official list of INGE members, the group is informally composed of scientists, engineers, and others from Argentina, Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Russia, the United States, and several other countries.  These members regularly contribute to better understanding radioactive xenon measurements through operation of samplers, measurements of background at various locations, creation of data analysis routines, etc.
Staff from the preparatory commission of the CTBTO oversaw the experiment, with technical assistance from a German group of noble gas experts from the BfS in Freiburg, Germany.  As of 2009, the experiment was still on-going, and so far it had consisted of 3 phases:

GS2,Palestinian right to resist,"This page is subject to the extended confirmed restriction related to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Palestinians' right to resist is a significant issue deeply rooted in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, particularly in relation to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. This right, recognized under international law, is based on the principle of self-determination for all peoples under foreign and colonial rule.
Under international law the right to resist excludes recourse to violence against civilians.

Right to armed resistance
Legal basis for the right to resist
Palestinians have a recognized right under international law to resist Israeli occupation under Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions. This right is affirmed in the context of the right of self-determination of all peoples under foreign and colonial rule. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has expressly affirmed the right of Palestinians to resist Israeli military occupation, including through armed struggle. General Assembly resolution A/RES/38/17 (22/11/1983) stated that it ""Reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for their independence, territorial integrity, national unity and liberation from colonial domination, apartheid and foreign occupation by all available means, including armed struggle"".

The right to self-defense
The question of self-defense in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is complex. Advocates argue that if Israel has the right to defend itself by launching airstrikes that destroy Palestinian homes, educational institutions, medical facilities and religious sites, then surely the Palestinians have the right to defend themselves from Israeli and settler violence.

GS2,Bad faith,"Bad faith (Latin: mala fides) is a sustained form of deception which consists of entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings while acting as if influenced by another. It is associated with hypocrisy, breach of contract, affectation, and lip service. It may involve intentional deceit of others, or self-deception.
Some examples of bad faith include: soldiers waving a white flag and then firing when their enemy approaches to take prisoners (cf. perfidy); a company representative who negotiates with union workers while having no intent of compromising; a prosecutor who argues a legal position that he knows to be false; and an insurer who uses language and reasoning which are deliberately misleading in order to deny a claim.
In philosophy, after Jean-Paul Sartre's analysis of the concepts of self-deception and bad faith, the latter concept has been examined in specialized fields as it pertains to self-deception as two semi-independently acting minds within one mind, with one deceiving the other. Bad faith may be viewed in some cases to not involve deception, as in some kinds of hypochondria with actual physical manifestations. There is a question about the truth or falsity of statements made in bad faith self-deception; for example, the veracity of a hypochondriac making a complaint about their psychosomatic condition.
Bad faith has been used as a term of art in diverse areas involving feminism, racial supremacism, political negotiation, insurance claims processing, intentionality, ethics, existentialism, climate change denial, and the law.

Definition
In the book Being and Nothingness (1943), the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre defined bad faith (Fr. mauvaise foi) as the action of a person hiding the truth from him- or herself. That ""the one to whom the lie is told and the one who lies are one and the same person, which means that I must know the truth, in my capacity as [the] deceiver, though [the truth] is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived"
GS2,South-East European Cooperation Process,"The South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP) was launched on Bulgaria's initiative in 1996. At the Bulgaria-chaired meeting in Sofia, the Southeast Europe (SEE) countries laid the foundations for regional co-operation for the purposes of creating an atmosphere of trust, good neighbourly relations and stability.
A special characteristic of SEECP is that it is an original form of co-operation among the countries in the region launched on their own initiative, and not on the initiative of some other international organisation or countries. In that regard, the SEECP seeks to define itself as an authentic voice of SEE, complementary to the Stability Pact, Southeast European Cooperative Initiative or the Stabilisation and Association Process.
The basic goals of regional co-operation within SEECP include the strengthening of security and the political situation, intensification of economic relations and co-operation in the areas of human resources, democracy, justice, and battle against illegal activities. It is the intention of the SEECP to enable its members to approach the European and Euro-Atlantic structures through the strengthening of good neighbourly relations and transformation of the region into an area of peace and stability.

GS2,Asylum seeker,"An asylum seeker is a person who leaves their country of residence, enters another country, and makes in that other country a formal application for the right of asylum according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 14. A person keeps the status of asylum seeker until the right of asylum application has concluded.
The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted the right of asylum protection or whether asylum will be refused and the asylum seeker becomes an illegal immigrant who may be asked to leave the country and may even be deported in line with non-refoulement. Signatories to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are accepted or rejected varies each year from country to country.
The asylum seeker may be simultaneously recognized as a refugee and given refugee status if their circumstances fall into the definition of refugee according to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or regionally applicable refugee laws—such as the European Convention on Human Rights, if within the European Union.
The terms asylum seeker, refugee and illegal immigrant are often confused. In North American English, the term asylee is used both for an asylum seeker, as defined above, and a person whose right of asylum has been granted.

Asylum and protection
The right of asylum according to the Article 14 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

1. Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
2. This right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

The Blue Flag is a trademark owned by FEE, which is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation consisting of more than 100 organisations spreading 81 countries.
FEE's Blue Flag criteria include standards for quality, safety, environmental education and information, the provision of services, and general environmental management. The Blue Flag is hence sought as an indication of high environmental and quality standards.
Certificates, which FEE refers to as awards, are issued on an annual basis to beaches and marinas of FEE member countries by the Blue Flag international jury. For a beach to be awarded, it must meet at least thirty of the Blue Flag's criteria spanning four categories. Meanwhile, for a marina to be awarded, it must meet at least thirty-eight criteria spanning six categories. The awards are announced yearly on 5 June for Europe, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia, and other countries in a similar geographic location, and on 1 November for the Caribbean, New Zealand, South Africa, and other countries in the southern hemisphere.
In the European Union, the water quality standards are incorporated in the EC Water Framework Directive.

GS2,Live fish trade,"The live fish trade can refer to the live food fish trade (for human consumption) or to the ornamental fish trade (for aquariums).  The fish can come from many places, but most comes from Southeast Asia.
The live food fish trade is a global system that links fishing communities with markets, primarily in Hong Kong and mainland China.  Many of the fish are captured on coral reefs in Southeast Asia or the Pacific Island nations.

Consumer demand
Within the live food trade there are certain types of fish demanded more often by consumers, particularly smaller and medium-sized fish. According to the book While Stocks Last: The Live Reef Food Fish Trade consumer demand has caused the fish captured on coral reefs to be the most valued fish in the trade. Consumers are important because they are directly purchasing these fish species at restaurants and stores. In addition to these types of fishes, many juvenile fish are used for the live food trade. There are also cultural and regional preferences among consumers, for example, Chinese consumers often prefer their fish to be reddish in color believing the color to be auspicious. These preferences inevitably affect the biodiversity of marine life making certain fish species rarer to find.
The life fish food trade is a lucrative business. According to University of Washington Professor Patrick Christie, live fish caught for food export earns approximately $6000 a ton. To help support themselves and their families, fishermen in Oceania and Southeast Asia sometimes use illegal fishing methods. Although many feel the fish are worth the cost, a typical dinner can cost up to one hundred dollars per kilogram. The wholesale value on these fish is anywhere from eleven US dollars to sixty-three US dollars per kilogram, meaning there’s a large markup and resale value. (Hong Kong alone is estimated to be about four hundred million US dollars a year.) Because this trade frequently uses illegal methods of collecting (using cyanide), there i"
GS2,Winter solstice,"The winter solstice, or hibernal solstice, occurs when either of Earth's poles reaches its maximum tilt away from the Sun. This happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the winter solstice is the day with the shortest period of daylight and longest night of the year, and when the Sun is at its lowest daily maximum elevation in the sky. Each polar region experiences continuous darkness or twilight around its winter solstice. The opposite event is the summer solstice.
The winter solstice occurs during the hemisphere's winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is the December solstice (December 21 or 22) and in the Southern Hemisphere, this is the June solstice (June 20 or 21). Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment, the term also refers to the day on which it occurs. Traditionally, in many temperate regions, the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter, ""midwinter"" is another name for the winter solstice, although it carries other meanings as well. Other names are the ""extreme of winter"", or the ""shortest day"".
Since prehistory, the winter solstice has been a significant time of year in many cultures and has been marked by festivals and rites. This is because it is the point when the shortening of daylight hours is reversed and the daytime begins to lengthen again. In parts of Europe it was seen as the symbolic death and rebirth of the Sun. Some ancient monuments such as Newgrange, Stonehenge, and Cahokia Woodhenge are aligned with the sunrise or sunset on the winter solstice.

History and cultural significance
There is evidence that the winter solstice was deemed an important moment of the annual cycle for some cultures as far back as the Neolithic (New Stone Age). Astronomical events were often used to guide farming activities, such as the mating of animals, the sowing of crops and the monitoring of winter reserves of food. Livestock were slaughtered so they would not have to be fed during the"
GS2,No Bra Day,"No Bra Day is an annual observance on October 13 on which women are encouraged to go braless as a means to encourage breast cancer awareness. No Bra Day was initially observed on July 9, 2011, but within three years it had moved to the 9th day of the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, August. Users on social media are encouraged to post using the hashtag #nobraday to promote awareness of breast cancer symptoms and to encourage gender equality. Some users on social media sites also encourage women to post pictures of themselves not wearing a bra. Some women embrace No Bra Day as a political statement while others prefer the comfort of discarding what they view as a restrictive, uncomfortable garment.
The observance has spread worldwide. The event was spun off a medical event in Toronto, Canada, that encourages breast cancer survivors to consider reconstructive surgery. First held on October 19, 2011, the medical event was named BRA (Breast Reconstruction Awareness) Day. It was adapted by an anonymous individual who conceived of No Bra Day as a way to encourage women to enjoy being braless and to become knowledgeable about breast cancer symptoms. The day is controversial as some see it as sexualizing and exploiting women's bodies while at the same time belittling a serious disease.

History
Event origins
The original event known as ""BRA Day"" was started by Toronto plastic surgeon Dr. Mitchell Brown. The first BRA Day event, titled ""Breast Reconstruction – An Evening of Learning and Sharing"", was held in Toronto, Canada at Women's College Hospital and Toronto General Hospital on October 19, 2011. Brown found that many Canadian women who underwent a mastectomy due to breast cancer resisted undergoing reconstructive surgery. He founded ""Breast Reconstruction Awareness"" (BRA) Day to increase women's awareness of the availability of reconstructive breast surgery. BRA day is intended to raise awareness of breast cancer screening, alert women to breast cancer symptoms, "
GS2,Open border,"An open border is a border that enables free movement of people and often of goods between jurisdictions with no restrictions on movement and is lacking a border control. A border may be an open border due to intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border (de jure), or a border may be an open border due to a lack of legal controls, a lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border (de facto). An example of the former is the Schengen Agreement between most members of the European Economic Area (EFTA and the EU). An example of the latter has been the border between Bangladesh and India, which is becoming controlled. The term ""open borders"" applies only to the flow of people, not the flow of goods and services, and only to borders between political jurisdictions, not to mere boundaries of privately owned property.
Open borders are the norm for borders between subdivisions within the boundaries of sovereign states, though some countries do maintain internal border controls (for example between the People's Republic of China mainland and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, or between the United States and the unincorporated territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa, and the Minor Outlying Islands). Open borders are also usual between member states of federations, though (very rarely) movement between member states may be controlled in exceptional circumstances. Federations, confederations and similar multi-national unions typically maintain external border controls through a collective border control system, though they sometimes have open borders with other non-member states through special international agreements –  such as between Schengen Agreement countries as mentioned above.
In the past, many states had open international borders either in practice or due to a lack of any legal restriction. Many authors, such as John Maynard Keynes, have identified the early 20th cent"

GS2,Monism and dualism in international law,"The terms monism and dualism are used to describe two different theories of the relationship between international law and domestic law. Monism and dualism both offer approaches to how international law comes into effect within states, and how conflicts between national and international law are resolved. In practice, many states are partly monist and partly dualist in their actual application of international law in their national systems.

Monism
Monists accept that the internal and international legal systems form a unity. Both national legal rules and international rules that a state has accepted, for example by way of a treaty, determine whether actions are legal or illegal. In most so-called ""monist"" states, a distinction between international law in the form of treaties, and other international law, e.g., customary international law or jus cogens, is made; such states may thus be partly monist and partly dualist.
In a pure monist state, international law does not need to be translated into national law. It is simply incorporated and has effect automatically in national or domestic laws. The act of ratifying an international treaty immediately incorporates the law into national law; and customary international law is treated as part of national law as well. International law can be directly applied by a national judge, and can be directly invoked by citizens, just as if it were national law. A judge can declare a national rule invalid if it contradicts international rules because, in some states, international rules have priority. In other states, like in Germany, treaties have the same effect as legislation, and by the principle of Lex posterior derogat priori (""Later law removes the earlier""), only take precedence over national legislation enacted prior to their ratification.
In its most pure form, monism dictates that national law that contradicts international law is null and void, even if it post-dates international law, and even if it is constitutional i"
GS2,List of telephone country codes,"Telephone country codes, originally termed International Codes by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (C.C.I.T.T.) in 1960, but also sometimes referred to as ""country dial-in codes"", or historically ""international subscriber dialing"" (ISD) codes in the U.K., are telephone number dialing prefixes for reaching subscribers in foreign countries or areas via international telecommunication networks. Country codes are defined by the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in ITU-T standards E.123 and E.164. The prefixes enable international direct dialing (IDD).
Country codes constitute the international telephone numbering plan. They are used only when dialing a telephone number in a country or world region other than the caller's. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number, but require at least one additional prefix, the international call prefix which is an exit code from the national numbering plan to the international one. In most countries, this prefix is 00, an ITU recommendation; it is 011 in the countries of the North American Numbering Plan while a minority of countries use other prefixes.

Overview
This table lists in its first column the initial digits of the country code shared by each country in each row, which is arranged in columns for the last digit (x). When three-digit codes share a common leading pair, the shared prefix is marked by an arrow, ( ↙ ) pointing down and left to the three-digit codes. Unassigned codes are denoted by a dash (—). Countries are identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes; codes for non-geographic services are denoted by two asterisks (**).

World numbering zones
The world numbering zones were defined by the C.C.I.T.T. in Recommendation E.29 in 1964. They were generally defined geographically, with exceptions for political and historical alignments. The terminology is largely obsolete.

Zone 1, the North American Numbering Plan, uses country code 1 plus a three-digit area "
GS2,Salzburg Forum,"The Salzburg Forum (SF) is a Central European security partnership of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
Member states cooperate in areas of police cooperation, illegal immigration, witness protection, fight against drugs, traffic safety and other areas of internal security.
They also focus on positions coordination and advancing common interests in the European Union in the area of Home Affairs.
At least two conferences of interior ministers per year are held.
As a rule, three SF ministerial meetings are held per year. One meeting takes place in the country holding the presidency and one further meeting is usually held in summer in Austria. In addition, ministers regularly meet in the margins of EU Council meetings.

Purpose
In a report on migration in the Czech Republic, the responsible Czech ministry published the following summary on SF.

“The Ministers of the Interior of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Austria, Slovakia, and Slovenia have cooperated within the Salzburg groups since the adoption of the Salzburg Declaration in 2001. Ministers of Bulgaria and Romania joined the group in 2005 as candidate countries of the European Union. This cooperation became a basis for close partnership of participating countries in activities relating to internal security and regional stability. The initial objective of the Salzburg Group was, through mutual cooperation and exchanges of experience, to facilitate the inclusion of candidate countries and new EU Member States into a single European area of freedom, security and justice, with priorities being police cooperation, border checks, illegal migration, and asylum. Activities of the Salzburg Group focus nowadays mainly on specific cooperation in the area of common regional issues in the context of membership of the Salzburg Group states in the European Union.

GS2,Senior Foreign Service,"The Senior Foreign Service (SFS) comprises the top four ranks of the United States Foreign Service.  These ranks were created by the Foreign Service Act of 1980 and Executive Order 12293 in order to provide the Foreign Service with senior grades equivalent to general and flag ranks in the military and naval establishments, respectively, and to grades in the Senior Executive Service.  Like military ranks and other Foreign Service ranks, the Senior Foreign Service grade system assigns rank in person, not rank in position.

Grade structure
The four grades, from highest to lowest, with their military and former Senior Executive Service  equivalents (i.e., prior to the SES's shift to an open-range compensation system), are:

Only one of these ranks, Career Ambassador, is established by law.  The Foreign Service Act of 1980 stipulates, ""The President may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, confer the personal rank of career ambassador upon a career member of the Senior Foreign Service in recognition of especially distinguished service over a sustained period.""  Otherwise, the 1980 Act states the President shall ""prescribe salary classes for the Senior Foreign Service and shall prescribe an appropriate title for each class.""  President Ronald Reagan established the other three Senior Foreign Service ranks with Executive Order 12293.

Protocol
According to McCaffree's Protocol: The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official & Social Usage, Career Ministers of the Senior Foreign Service are to be accorded the honorific ""The Honorable"".  Career Ambassadors, as ambassadors, are accorded the honorific ""Her/His Excellency"".

Pay scale
The Senior Foreign Service pay system is an open-range, performance-based pay system that is linked to the Senior Executive Service (SES) pay system. SFS members, like SES members, are not entitled to automatic across-the-board increases and locality-based comparability payments. Instead, pay adjustments are based on a member's indivi"

GS2,Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden,"The dissolution of the union (Bokmål: unionsoppløsningen; Nynorsk: unionsoppløysinga; Landsmål: unionsuppløysingi; Swedish: unionsupplösningen) between the kingdoms of Norway and Sweden under the House of Bernadotte, was set in motion by a resolution of the Storting on 7 June 1905. Following some months of tension and fear of an outbreak of war between the neighbouring kingdoms (then in personal union) – and a Norwegian plebiscite held on 13 August which overwhelmingly backed dissolution – negotiations between the two governments led to Sweden's recognition of Norway as an independent constitutional monarchy on 26 October 1905. On that date, King Oscar II renounced his claim to the Norwegian throne, effectively dissolving the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, and this event was swiftly followed, on 18 November, by the accession to the Norwegian throne of Prince Carl of Denmark, taking the name of Haakon VII.

Background
Norwegian nationalistic aspirations in 1814 were frustrated by Sweden's victory in a brief but decisive war that resulted in Norway entering into a personal union with Sweden.  The Norwegian constitution was largely kept intact. Norway legally had the status of an independent state with its own parliament, judiciary, legal system, armed forces, flag, and currency. However, Norway and Sweden shared a common monarch and conducted a common foreign policy through the Swedish ministry of foreign affairs. There largely existed feelings of goodwill between the two peoples, and the King generally tried to act in the interest of both Kingdoms.
However, over the years, a divergence of Norwegian and Swedish interests became apparent. In particular, Norwegians felt that their foreign policy interests were inadequately served by Sweden's ministry of foreign affairs. There were several driving factors behind the growing conflict:

The Norwegian economy was more dependent on foreign trade and thus more sensitive to the protectionist measures favored by the merc"

GS2,International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition,"The International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition (French: Journée internationale du souvenir de la traite négrière et de son abolition) is an international day celebrated 23 August of each year, the day designated by UNESCO to memorialize the transatlantic slave trade.
That date was chosen by the adoption of resolution 29 C/40 by the Organization's General Conference at its 29th session. Circular CL/3494 of 29 July 1998, from the Director-General invited Ministers of Culture to promote the day. The date is significant because, during the night of 22 August to 23 August 1791, on the island of Saint Domingue (now known as Haiti), an uprising began which set forth events which were a major factor in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.
UNESCO Member States organize events every year on that date, inviting  participation from young people, educators, artists and intellectuals. As part of the goals of the intercultural UNESCO project, ""The Slave Route"", it is an opportunity for collective recognition and focus on the ""historic causes, the methods and the consequences"" of slavery. Additionally, it sets the stage for analysis and dialogue of the interactions which gave rise to the transatlantic trade in human beings between Africa, Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean.

Activity within different nations
The International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition was first celebrated in a number of countries, in particular in Haiti on 23 August 1998, and Senegal on 23 August 1999. A number of cultural events and debates were organized.

GS2,Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence,"Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a statement adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia (previously Southern Rhodesia), a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, it was the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. The UK, the Commonwealth, and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. With the help of the Commonwealth Secretariat, members of the Commonwealth were able to cooperate and advise Rhodesian Africans on policy. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and (until 1974) Portugal.
The Rhodesian government, which mostly comprised members of the country's white minority of about 5%, was indignant when, amid the UK colonial government's Wind of Change policies of decolonisation, African colonies to the north without comparable experience of self-rule quickly advanced to independence during the early 1960s while Rhodesia was refused sovereignty under the newly ascendant principle of ""no independence before majority rule"" (""NIBMAR""). Most white Rhodesians felt that they were due independence following four decades of self-government, and that the British government was betraying them by withholding it.
A stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers, Harold Wilson and Ian Smith respectively, between 1964 and 1965. The dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable ""to the people of the country as a whole"""

GS3,Sikkim tea,"Sikkim tea is a variety of tea grown in the state of Sikkim, India. Sikkim tea is not as widespread in use as the neighboring Darjeeling tea, however it has recently gained more popularity due to the increasing demand for organic products. The tea is mostly sold under the marketing name 'Temi tea'. Unlike Darjeeling tea, Sikkim tea has yet to receive a GI tag.

History
Tea farming in Sikkim is primarily dominated by the Temi Tea Garden (owned by the Sikkim state government) and various other small tea growers. The first and still the largest tea garden in Sikkim, the Temi Tea Garden was established by the erstwhile king Palden Thondup Namgyal as a source of employment for the large number of Tibetan refugees living in the region.

Tea characteristics
The first flush of Sikkim tea is harvested during springtime and has a unique taste and aroma. The tea is golden in color and has a light floral finish. It has a slightly sweet taste. Sikkim tea has a toasty and strong flavour. The third flush (also called Monsoon Flush) is full-bodied and has a mellow taste. The final flush (or Autumn Flush) of the Sikkim tea has a well-rounded taste and the slight hint of warm spices.

Production and sale
The temperate weather and altitude of the state favor tea cultivation and the tea is known for its distinct flavor and aroma. Sikkim produces two varieties of tea, a China variety and a clone variety. The clone variety is a newy introduced cultivar with the China variety being grown traditionally. Sikkim, with its only garden and few other small growers, produces an estimated 0.5 million kg of tea annually. The usual produce is Black Tea, while a delicate white tea manufactured from the buds and unfurled new leaves is also grown to order. A green tea, known for its flowery flavor; and the Oolong tea are also produced.
Approximately 75 per cent of tea produced in Sikkim is sold via the Kolkata auction center while the remaining is packaged for local sale. The tea is popular in the int"
GS3,Bhoomi (software),"Bhoomi online is a project jointly funded by the Government of India and the Government of Karnataka to digitize the paper land records and create a software mechanism to control changes to the land registry in Karnataka.  The project was designed to eliminate the long-standing problem of inefficiency and corruption in the maintenance of land records at dispersed and poorly supervised and audited block-level offices known as ""taluka"" offices in South India and ""tehsildar"" offices in North India. The project development and implementation was done by National Informatics Centre.
Many experiments with computerization have failed due to corruption and other factors.

Implementation of Land record computerization has been difficult in India. Bhoomi succeeded because there was a champion who worked a 15-hour day for over 12 months, devoting 80% of his time to the project. Minimizing resistance from staff by harnessing political support was an important contributory factor. Extensive training coupled with a participatory style also helped to diminish resistance.""

Background
The idea to computerize land records was first mooted by Chief Minister of Karnataka S. M. Krishna in 1999. In his 2000–01 budget speech, he stated: ""I am making a solemn commitment in this House that by March 31, 2001, RTCs in computerised format will be made available to every single farmer in the State."" In his next budget speech, he said that RTCs were ""available at kiosks in 40 taluks across the State. In a few months the remaining 125 taluks will be able to get RTCs."" It was reported in 2004 that the Bhoomi project included demographic and economic data and legal rights, and that it also had 47 information fields on owner, tenant, crops, yield, irrigation sources, mortgage details, nature of soil and bank loans.

The Pranahita River is itself a confluence of various smaller tributaries including the Wardha, Painganga, and Wainganga rivers which combine to form the seventh-largest drainage basin on the subcontinent, with an estimated annual discharge of more than 6,427,900 acre-feet (7,930 cubic hectometres) or 280 TMC. It remains untapped as its course is principally through dense forests and other ecologically sensitive zones such as wildlife sanctuaries.
The Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project is divided into 7 links and 28 packages spanning a distance of approximately 500 km (310 mi) through 13 districts and utilizing a canal network of more than 1,800 km (1,100 mi). The project aims to produce a total of 240 TMC (195 from Medigadda Barrage, 20 from Sripada Yellampalli project and 25 from groundwater), of which 169 has been allocated for irrigation, 30 for Hyderabad municipal water, 16 for miscellaneous industrial uses and 10 for drinking water in nearby villages, with the remainder being estimated evaporation loss.

GS3,Amul,"Anand Milk Union Limited commonly known as Amul is an Indian dairy brand owned by the cooperative society, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), based in Anand, Gujarat. GCMMF is controlled by 3.6 million milk producers.
Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel founded the organisation in 1946 and served as its chairman until his retirement in the 1970s. He hired Verghese Kurien in 1949, initially as the general manager, where Kurien guided the technical and marketing efforts of the cooperative. Kurien briefly became the chairman of Amul following Patel's death in 1994, and is credited with the success of Amul's marketing.
Amul spurred India's White Revolution, which made the country the world's largest producer of milk and milk products, and has since ventured into overseas markets.

History
Amul was founded on 14 December 1946 as a response to the exploitation of small dairy farmers by traders and agents. At the time, milk prices were arbitrarily determined, giving Polson an effective monopoly in milk collection from Kaira and its subsequent supply to Mumbai.
Frustrated with the trade practices (which they perceived as unfair), the farmers of Kaira, led by Tribhuvandas Patel, approached Vallabhbhai Patel, who advised them to form a cooperative. If they did so, they would be able to directly supply their milk to the Bombay Milk Scheme instead of working for Polson. Sardar Patel sent Morarji Desai to organise the farmers.
Following a meeting in Chaklasi, the farmers formed the cooperative and resolved not to provide Polson with any more milk. Milk collection was decentralised, as most producers were marginal farmers who could deliver, at most, 1–2 litres of milk per day. Cooperatives were formed for each village. By June 1948, the KDCMPUL had started pasteurising milk for the Bombay Milk Scheme. Then-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri visited Anand to inaugurate Amul's cattle feed factory. On 31 October 1964, he spoke to farmers about their cooperative. After r"

GS3,Animal Welfare Board of India,"The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), headquartered at Ballabhgarh in Haryana state, is a statutory advisory body advising the Government of India's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying (Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying). The AWBI headquarters were previously situated in Chennai.

History
The Animal Welfare Board of India was established in 1962 under Section 4 of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Well-known humanitarian Rukmini Devi Arundale participated in setting up the board and was its first chair. The Board consists of 28 Members, who serve for a period of 3 years. Its headquarters were in Chennai, and moved to Ballabhgarh in Faridabad district of Haryana in early 2018.
The board was initially within the jurisdiction of the Government of India's Ministry of Food and Agriculture. In 1990, the subject of prevention of cruelty to animals was transferred to the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, where it is now managed by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying. R.M. Kharb was the first veterinarian to have been appointed as AWBI chairperson in the five-decade history of the board.

Lab animals
Concerned about the abuse of animals in research, in the board's early history, it recommended that the government create the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The committee was created, and the board's representative Dr. S. Chinny Krishna deposed twice before the Committee about ""the dismal state of laboratories in India.""
A number of years passed before the subject was ""taken up effectively by the Government."" In 2001, the government passed rules covering the breeding and experimentation on animals.

GS3,Kuhl irrigation (Himachal Pradesh),"The Kuhl irrigation system in the Kangra Valley of Himachal Pradesh is a remarkable example of traditional community-managed gravity flow irrigation. This system plays a crucial role in supporting agriculture in the region, allowing farmers to efficiently utilize water resources in the challenging Himalayan terrain.
The Kangra Valley, situated at the base of the Dhauladhar mountain range, features forested alluvial plains sloping down from the mountains. The valley is intersected by small streams known as nalas and perennial rivers, or khads, which are fed by glacial melts from the Dhauladhar range and eventually join the Beas River.
The Kuhl irrigation system involves a sophisticated network of canals and channels that crisscross the landscape. These canals are designed to utilize gravity for the flow of water, allowing it to reach various agricultural fields in a controlled and organized manner. The term ""Kuhl"" is derived from the local dialect and signifies the interconnected nature of these canals, which are carefully managed by the local communities.
The success of the Kuhl system lies in its ability to harness water from small streams and rivers, distributing it effectively to support crop cultivation. This traditional water management system not only addresses the challenges posed by the Himalayan terrain but also represents the collective wisdom and ingenuity of the local communities.
Similar water management systems, such as the Kuls of Spiti and Guls of Kashmir, highlight the diversity of approaches employed by different regions to address their specific water needs. These systems, rooted in local knowledge and practices, contribute significantly to sustaining agriculture and livelihoods in their respective areas.

It is situated near the state border of Tamil Nadu about 25 kilometres northeast of the district seat Painavu  and 8 kilometres north of the subdistrict seat Devikulam. In 2011, it was home to 55,738 residents.
The village was given on lease on 11 July 1877 by the Poonjar Thampuran to John Daniel Munroe of London and Peermade for tea plantation. The lands and plantations were later resumed by the Government of Kerala through the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption Of Lands) Act, 1971.

History
Traditional states that Col. Arthur Wellesley, the later Duke of Wellington, was the first English man to have set foot in the High Range during the Battle of Nedumkotta. The earliest available record about this region is in a terrain survey of 1816-17 by Lt. Benjamin Swayne Ward, son of Col. Francis Swayne Ward.
There were a few more expeditions into the area, including one led by Col. Douglas Hamilton in 1862 and one led by John Daniel Munro in 1877. Munro was given a lease of land in the same year as his expedition, and he opened his own tea plantation three years later. More plantations were constructed in the 1880s and 1890s. In 1897, Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company was registered to operate the local tea plantations.
Following the Independence of India, this area remained in the hands of British enterprises. In 1971, the Government of Kerala passed the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, and transferred the control of the region back to Indian government. Kannan Devan Hills remains as a revenue village ever since.

GS3,Areca nut production in India,"Areca nut production in India is dominant in the coastal region within 400 kilometres (250 mi) from the coast line, and also in some other non-coastal states of India. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a tropical crop, is popularly known as betel nut, as its common usage in the country is for mastication with betel leaves. It is a palm tree species under the family of Arecaceae. It has commercial and economic importance not only in India but also in China and  Southeast Asia.
Areca nut production in India is the largest in the world, as per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) statistics for 2017, accounting for 54.07% of its world output, and is exported to many countries.  Within India, as of 2013–14, Karnataka produces 62.69% of the crop followed by Kerala and Assam; all three states together account for 88.59% of its production. In the other states of Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, where it is also consumed, the crop is  grown in a very small area. In Karnataka, in the Uttara Kannada District and Shivamogga District the crop is grown extensively

History
Areca nut is not a native crop of India. It is generally believed to be native to Malaysia or Philippines where it is grown in many varieties. It is a tropical crop which grows from West Indies to the East Coast of Africa, and in Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka and Malaya. The practice of chewing the areca nuts is attributed to Vietnam and Malaysia. It was from Southeast Asia that the crop spread to Asia and India where it is cultivated as a cash crop. It is conjectured that ancient Indian literature provide information on betel nut and its mastication. The Indian Ayurveda texts also refer to the areca nuts as a traditional medicine.
Its use in India is also noted from the pre-vedic period and was described by the word taamboola in ancient Indian civilization. It is extensively used in  Hindu religious rites of birth, marriage, nuptial and is also offered to guests as a mark of hospit"

Under the scheme, the government plans to issue soil cards to farmers which will carry crop-wise recommendations of nutrients and fertilisers required for the individual farms to help farmers to improve productivity through judicious use of inputs. All soil samples are to be tested in various soil testing labs across the country. Thereafter the experts will analyse the strength and weaknesses (micro-nutrients deficiency) of the soil and suggest measures to deal with it. The result and suggestion will be displayed in the cards. The government plans to issue the cards to 14 crore farmers.

Scheme
The scheme aims at promoting soil test based and balanced use of fertilisers to enable farmers to realise higher yields at lower cost. also
the main objective is to aware growers about the appropriate amount of nutrients for the concerned crop depending on the quality of soil. It covers 12 Parameters.

Budget
An amount of ₹568 crore (US$65 million) was allocated by the government for the scheme. In 2016 Union budget of India, ₹100 crore (US$11 million) has been allocated to states for making soil health cards and set up labs.

GS3,Zaid crop,"Zaid crops are summer season crops. They grow for a short time period between Rabi and Kharif crops, mainly from March to June. These crops are mainly grown in the summer season during a period called the Zaid crop season. They require warm dry weather as major growth period and longer day length for flowering. Some summer months and rainy season is required. These crops also mature early.
In between the Rabi and the Kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer months known as the Zaid season. Some of the crops produced during Zaid season are watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, vegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane(doesn’t require the need to fall into any season like rabi,etc. to be sown) takes almost a year to grow.

Digital Green works across seven states in India, parts of Ethiopia, Ghana and Afghanistan. The organization engages over 150,000 farmers (over 70% women) in more than 2,000 villages. It received an Rs 3 crore Global Impact Award from Google in 2013, and Manthan award in 2012. Rikin Gandhi, the Chief Executive Officer of Digital Green, was awarded IFA Norman Borlaug Award by the International Fertilizer Industry Association in 2012.

Loop
With time, it was found that smallholder farmers in rural India spend anywhere from a half to a full day selling their produce at the nearest market while also incurring transport costs. To reduce costs, Digital Green created Loop, a mobile app based intervention that improves farmers’ access to markets by helping them to aggregate their perishable produce through a local village level entrepreneur trained to use the app and aggregate - himself a farmer.
Digital Green nurtures these village-level entrepreneurs to recruit farmers, assess daily produce volumes, determine which nearby market offers the best price, arrange transport based on volume, and sell farmers’ produce directly to wholesale buyers. They record volumes and sales on the Loop mobile app, which sends receipts to farmers via text messages. After completing transactions on behalf of all farmers, the entrepreneurs return to the villages to deliver same-day payment and earn their commission.

GS3,Coconut production in Kerala,"Kerala or Keralam (as it is known in the region's Malayalam language) are called ‘alam’ meaning ‘the land of’, and ‘kera’ meaning ‘coconut’. Jammed between the sea and coastal mountains, Kerala is subject to the monsoon rains that flood the land and the rice paddies on the subcontinent’s southern tip. Long growing seasons yield a coconut crop every 40 days, with each tree producing 20 to 30 coconuts per harvest. Keralites, most of whom seem to have at least four or five trees on their small plots of land, claim they are Kalpa Vriksham —“the trees of heaven.” They use the  coconuts themselves for food, tender coconuts for water and spirituous toddy for drinking; the fronds for mats and roofs; the oil for cooking; and the husk fibre for a thriving rope industry. They are intrinsically tied to the culture and folklore well. It is a part of every celebration —as an ingredient in the Keralan delicacies prepared, as offering to the gods and to mark an auspicious occasion (by breaking a coconut). Various terms like copra and coir are derived from the native Malayalam language. 
By the late 1970s it accounted for some 68% of total production in India and at one stage some 8,99,198 hectares were reportedly under cultivation. Today Kerala produces roughly 45% of India's coconuts, with some 92% of total production lying in the southern Indian states and Kerala's neighbours. The Coconut Development Board which plays an important role in the development of coconut production in India has its headquarters in Kochi, Kerala. One problem which poses a major threat to production in Kerala is 'Root Wilt Disease'.

Places with high cultivation
Coastal regions have sandy soils which is the best for coconut trees which results in a higher yield of the produce (fruit). In Kerala Interior places with fertile soils and plain regions also give good growth to coconut trees.

In 2011, the amount of land used for agriculture decreased in greater degrees than in previous years like 1991 and 2000, owing this to government land acquisition. 2011 is the year when land rehabilitation bills combating land acquisition were starting to be proposed, but it is evident that the government has been progressively reducing the resources allocated to agriculture in India. Additionally, there was an almost 2 percent increase in the use of non agricultural land in the decade following 2001. Overall, these land acquisition schemes and urbanizing agendas of the government have resulted in more than 20 million people being forced from their lands in the last 40 years, with 70% not receiving proper compensation and relocation. When considering the amount of displacement since the start of independence in India, this number grows to as high as 50 million afflicted by land acquisition, with 10% of the nation's productive land taken for purposes differing from the original intended use of the land.

Legislative powers and limits
Until 2013, the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 governed land acquisition in India. The 1894 Act provided compensation to landowners but did not provide any form of compensation to other persons affected by the acquisition. The older law did not clearly define public purpose or fair compensation. After a number of attempts, the UPA government was able to replace the 1894 Act with Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (2013 LARR Act).
The 2013 LARR Act focuses on providing not only compensation to the land ow"

GS3,Harsha Chhina,"Harsha Chhina is a village in the state of Punjab, India, three kilometers from Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport, Amritsar, on Ajnala Road. Harse is an Urdu word which means three villages (Uchla Quila, Vichla Quila, and Sabajpura). It is one of biggest villages in Ajnala and Rajasansi Constituency. It has a population of about 6,500. Until 1968 the village had one Panchayat and thereafter each sub village got respective new Panchayats. However, now there is another sub village Kukranwala with independent panchayat that has evolved from this village. Harsha Chhina, previously under Block Development Office Chogawan, has now itself become a new Block Development Office, situated in Kukranwala. Harsha Chhina is also referred as Chhine The Wale, because there used to be an ancient, huge and tall mountain-like structure known as The in Punjabi, situated about half a kilometre west of Vichla Quila. This The was visible from surrounding villages in an approximately 10-kilometre radius. This prominent feature, which existed until the late 1990s, has disappeared, as it has been leveled and illegally occupied by the neighbouring farmers.

Harsha Chhina Mogha Morcha: revolution against British Empire
The Harse Chhina Mogha Morcha was an agrarian revolt in Punjab, that took place 1946–1947. The campaign was launched in 1946, under the leadership of the Communist Party. The movement had been launched in response to a decision from the Punjab Government to decrease the supply of water irrigation to farmers, by remodelling the moghas (canal outlets). The campaign was headed by Comrade Achhar Singh Chhina, Sohan Singh Josh, Mohan Singh Batth, Baba Karam Singh Cheema, Jagbir Singh Chhina, and Gurdial Singh Dhillon. During the campaign, a few leaders and 950 protesting peasants were arrested by police and detained in Lahore jail for three months.
As a result of this movement an all party-negotiation was held with the Revenue Minister and the government official on providi"
GS3,Tractors in India,"Tractors in India are a major industry and significant contributor to its agriculture output gains.
In 1947, as India gained independence from the British Empire, the level of agriculture mechanisation was low. The socialist oriented five-year plans of the 1950s and 1960s aggressively promoted rural mechanisation via joint ventures and tie-ups between local industrialists and international tractor manufacturers. Despite these efforts, the first three decades after independence local production of 4-wheel tractors grew slowly. By the late 1980s tractor production was nearly 140,000 units per year, and a prevalence rate of less than 2 per 1,000 farmers.
After economic reforms of 1991, the pace of change increased and by late 1990s with production approached 270,000 per year. In early 2000s, India overtook the United States as the world's largest producer of four-wheel tractors. FAO estimated, in 1999, that of total agricultural area in India, less than 50% is under mechanised land preparation, indicating large opportunities still exist for agricultural mechanisation.
In 2013, India produced 619,000 tractors accounting for 29% of world's output, as the world's largest producer and market for tractors. India currently has 16 domestic and 4 multinational corporations manufacturing tractors.

History
1945 to 1960
War surplus tractors and bulldozers were imported for land reclamation and cultivation in mid-1940s. In 1947 central and state tractor organisations were set up to develop and promote the supply and use of tractors in agriculture and up to 1960, the demand was met entirely through imports. There were 8,500 tractors in use in 1951, 20,000 in 1955 and 37,000 by 1960.In this period Massey Ferguson entered India With Massey Ferguson 35x and 135

GS3,Nano Ganesh,"Nano Ganesh is an irrigation automation system that allows farmers to use mobile phones to remotely control irrigation pumps. It is a hardware device that attaches to a starter/water pump set.

History
The development in India of various wireless remote controllers began in 1996. Santosh Ostwal, an electrical engineer founded Ossian Agro Automation in Pune. The application initially supported basic mobile phones and later built-in GSM modules named Nano Ganesh GSM.  Approximately 60,000 farmers in India have been using Nano Ganesh since 2008. In mid-2009, it was tested in Anand district in Gujarat in partnership with Tata Teleservices. Later, it was enhanced to operate on any basic mobile phone. In 2014, Ossian further upgraded the technology as Nano Ganesh M2M to monitor the water level of overhead water tanks and remotely control the water pump as per the lower and overflow levels of water in the tanks.

Usage
In some parts of India, farmers have to walk several kilometers to turn on the irrigation pumps that water their fields. With the electrical supply often erratic, they sometimes have no electricity when they reach the pump. Nano Ganesh allows them to remotely check the availability of electricity, and to remotely turn the pump on and off. It helps the farmers to easily access the water pumps avoiding travel over difficult terrain, bad weather, and hazards. It also means growers don't have to wake up in the middle of the night, which is often the time electricity is available, to go to their fields.

Specifications
The application combines a modem with a basic mobile connection and a feature phone that attaches to the starter on the irrigation pump (Latest models do not eliminate the feature phone). Using the mobile phone, the farmer can switch on or off the water pump by text message or dialing assigned code numbers for on and off. It provides acknowledges the status of the power or pump by particular tone signals and texts.

GS3,Panchami Land,"Panchami land is the assigned land which was distributed for Dalits in Tamil Nadu during the British rule in 1892. It can neither be sold nor re-classified.

History
In 1891, the Chingleput collector J. H. A. Tremenheere submitted his study on socio-economic condition of Dalits in Tamil Nadu to the British administration. Based on his recommendation Depressed Classes Land Act was passed on September 30 under Government Order No 1010/10-A (revenue) 1892. And 12 lakh acres were assigned to Dalits across Tamil Nadu.

Retrieval of Panchami Lands
Most of the panchami lands were occupied by non dalits in the names of others and pattas were transferred by officials. Even the State government has allotted panchami lands to Special Economic Zones or Industrial parks. The struggle for retrieval of panchami land is being organized by various groups. Around 750 acres of Panchami land in Melur taluk were allegedly encroached by granite companies involved in quarrying scam
Government had constituted first state-level retrieve committee in 1991–1996 to study and submit a report suggesting modalities for retrieving panchami lands occupied by non-Dalits and restoring its ownership to Dalits. The next panel was headed by Justice M. Maruthamuthu in January 2011. Three-member third committee was formed on October 8, 2013, with secretaries of revenue and Adi Dravidar and tribal welfare departments as its members.

In Chhattisgarh, the total cultivable land area is 46.77 lakh hectares. 70% population of the state is engaged in agriculture and around 37.46 Lakh are farm families. The objective of this scheme is to encourage crop production and increase agricultural acreage. The amount of Rs. 5750 crores provided under the scheme was transferred to the farmers' accounts in four installments. 19 lakh farmers in the state are benefiting from this scheme. Paddy, maize and sugarcane (Rabi) crops were included in the initial year of the plan. In the year 2020–21, it has also been decided to include pulses and oilseed crops. The government of Chhattisgarh has also decided to include the landless agricultural laborers of the state in the second phase of the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana.
On 17 October 2022, Farmers received Rs 1745 crore to prepare for the upcoming Kharif season under this scheme. Amount as input subsidy transferred directly into the bank accounts of 23.99 lakh farmers in the state. This includes those farmers who take paddy, the main crop of the Kharif season, other Kharif crops, those who take other crops instead of paddy and the farmers who plant trees.

Objectives of scheme
Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana was started by the Chhattisgarh government led by Bhupesh Baghel with the objective of encouraging the farmers of Chhattisgarh for crop production and increasing the agricultural area. This is one of its kind big scheme for the farmers in the country.

GS3,Timber mafia,"Timber mafia refers to organized crime in the field of illegal logging in timber.

Bhutan
Bhutan's forests have been exploited by the “timber mafia” from neighboring Assam. The phenomenon has increased in the last decade.

Brazil
Brazil has rampant illegal logging, with deforestation increasing in 2013. The mafia intimidate opponents, however they also have a veneer of legitimacy.
According to a study by the Imazon, close to 70 percent of logging in Pará was without State authorization.

Cambodia
Since 2003, a third of all forests in Cambodia have disappeared. The timber mafia wields huge power and have alleged links to government.

Congo
Congo is also a victim of the illegal timber trade.

India
Protected forest areas in parts of India – such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Jharkhand – are vulnerable to illegal logging by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry. Non-state groups have joined the nexus in militancy-affected areas such as Kashmir. Clear-cutting is sometimes covered-up by conniving officials who report fictitious forest fires. 
Many studies indicate large losses of forest cover to indiscriminate logging by timber mafias, with over a million hectares in the environs of Chhotanagpur alone being illegally transferred by the forest department directly to industrial, mining and logging companies. Besides the environmental degradation, public financial losses can be substantial: One 1994 estimate of stolen timber in the state of Karnataka amounted to Rs. 10 billion (about US$230 million). Veerappan was a notorious bandit who, until his shooting death by state police in 2004, specialised in illegally logging sandalwood in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

GS3,James Sykes Gamble,"James Sykes Gamble  (2 July 1847 – 16 October 1925) was an English botanist who specialized in the flora of the Indian sub-continent; he became Director of the British Imperial Forest School at Dehradun, and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Early life and education
Gamble was born at Portland Place, London, the second son of Harpur Gamble, M.D., R.N. and Isabella. He completed his formal education at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, before going up to Oxford, where he attended Magdalen College, studying mathematics, gaining a First in the Final Schools in 1868. In the same year, he sat for the Indian Civil Service examinations, and gained an appointment in the Indian Forest Department the following year. Gamble later studied at the École nationale des eaux et forêts, Nancy (1869-1871) where he gained an interest in taxonomy.

Career
Gamble sailed for India in 1871 to join the Imperial Forest Department, and ultimately became Director of the Imperial Forest School at Dehradun. His first posting was in Burma but after a year he moved to Bengal where he worked in the Darjeeling forests. Here he produced the first list of the trees and shrubs of Darjeeling. From 1872 to 1877 he worked mostly in the Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri area with short visits to Allahabad and Shimla. In 1877 he moved to the capital in Shimla where he worked on the local flora.

History
ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) at Karnal, Haryana is one of the premier institutes in the dairy sector, which has contributed a lot in the growth of the dairy industry and played a crucial role in India's development in milk production with its continuous research. Over ninety nine years old NDRI's lineage goes back to the Imperial Institute for Animal Husbandry & Dairying which was set up in Bangalore in 1923 as a center for dairy education. In its erstwhile form of Imperial Institute in Bangalore, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and ‘Bharat Ratna’ Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, were imparted training at the institute in 1927. They wanted to get acquainted with modern methods of cattle management and spent two weeks discussing and learning technicalities and complexities of problems pertaining to cows and buffalos in India. Gandhiji was highly appreciative of the most productive crossbred cow ‘Jill’ of the institute. He held several discussions on the problems of Pinjrapoles, which housed low-producing, mostly sterile cows and other dairy stock mainly on humanitarian grounds. Mahatma Gandhi evinced great interest in the work of the institute and wrote several articles in `Young India’ and `Harijan’ on the importance of dairying and scientific cattle management.

The Government of India honoured him in 1957, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth-highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation and followed it up with the third-highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1970.

Biography
Ramiah, born in 1892, started his career, in 1914, as a member of research staff at the Paddy Breeding Station in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. In three years time, by 1917, he produced new crossbreeds of rice though pure line selection and breed improvement. Later, he introduced systematic hybridisation programmes, known to be the first Indian scientist to pursue such a protocol in rice breeding. When the Government of India established the Central Rice Research Institute in 1946, Ramiah was selected to head the institution as its founder director and continued at his post when the institute was later brought under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. During his tenure there, he also led the International Rice Commission, a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) initiative. He was reported to have contributed to the FAO sponsored Indo-Japonica Hybridization programme which yielded the nitrogen responsive rice varieties of Mahsuri, Malinja, ADT 27 and Circna, the first two released in Malaysia, the third in India and the last one, in Australia.

SKUAST-J came into existence on 20 September 1999 following the amendment in Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology Act 1982 through the State legislature. The university inherited few assets and staff deployed at various stations and sub-stations from erstwhile SKUAST (J&K) to carry on the mission of agriculture research and development. Currently Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Faculty of Dairy Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering, Faculty of Horticulture & Forestry and School of Biotechnology are located at Chatha (Main Campus), Jammu whereas the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry (F.V.Sc & A.H) is located at R. S. Pura, Jammu.

History
The Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology,  J & K was established in 1982 with the objectives of catering to the research, education and extension education requirements of the state. The entire educational infrastructure like colleges of Agriculture, Veterinary and Forestry came up in Kashmir province only and major infrastructure for research and extension was also developed in the same region.
Subsequently, demand for the establishment of a separate Agriculture University for Jammu region was desired because the Jammu region is different from the Kashmir division with regard to its livestock, type and pattern of cropping and other factors. The problems of Jammu region are location-specific in research on crops, pulses, fruits, oil-seeds, vegetables, agriculture, species of livestock and poultry.
Keeping these considerations in view, the then Prime Minister of India, Sh. H.D. Deve Gowda, during his visit to Jammu in 1996, announced the establishment of a separate Agricultural University for Jammu region. His succ"

It is a federation of milk producers under the ownership of Ministry of Cooperation, Government of Karnataka. Almost every district in Karnataka has milk-producing co-operatives. The milk is collected from farmers who are its members, processed and sold in the market under the Nandini brand. It is the second-largest milk co-operative in India after Amul.

Background
The first dairy co-operatives that make up KMF started in 1955 in Kudige, Kodagu District. KMF was founded in 1974 as Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDDC) to implement a dairy development project run by the World Bank. In 1984 the organisation was renamed KMF. KMF has 15 milk unions throughout the Karnataka State which procure milk from Primary Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and distribute milk to the consumers in various urban and rural markets in Karnataka State with 1,500 members.

Operations
Occasionally, there is spillover from Karnataka politics into the activities of KMF, including the elections for the post of chairman, and the timing of the milk price hike.

GS3,Fishery Survey of India,"The Fishery Survey of India (FiSI), founded in 1983 by the Government of India's Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, for the fisheries studies, research and survey of the traditional and deep sea fisheries of India within India's Exclusive economic zone, is tasked with the preparation of an annual Fishery Resources Survey and ""Assessment and Research Programme"" for the sustainable fishery requirements of traditional fishermen, small and medium boat operators and industrial fleet of deep-sea longlining tuna fishing.

History
FiSI, founded in 1983, has its origin in the establishment of ""Deep Sea Fishing Station"" pilot project 
by government in 1946. In 1974 it was renamed ""Exploratory Fisheries Project"" and granted the status of an institute. In 1983, after Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) come into force by UNCLS in 1982, the institute was renamed ""Fishery Survey of India"" and designated a national institute. In 2005 the Marine Engineering Division was transferred to FiSI from NIFPHATT. In 2016, the institute moved to its new headquarter at Sassoon Dock of Colaba in Mumbai. On 27 July 2017, ""Deep Sea Fishing Project"" was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to end the bottom trawling fishing by providing incentives to 2,000 trawlers from Palk Bay to diversify into deep sea fishing.

Importance
India, with 8,118km coastline, 2 million square kilometres Exclusive economic zone including 530,000km2 continental shelf and 6.3% of the world fisheries production, is second largest fisheries producer after China with 9.58 million tonnes total production and 1.05 million tonnes export worth INR 334.4 billion (US$5.57 billion) export revenue, with marine fishing constituting 35% share, 70% from west coast and 30% from east coast (2014-2015). India has 14 million people employed in fisheries, including 1.9 million fishermen with 80,000 mechanised fishing vessels, 75,000 motorised fishing boats and 50,000 traditional non-motorised fishing boats.

GS3,Poush Mela,"Poush Mela (Bengali: পৌষ মেলা) is an annual fair and festival that takes place in Santiniketan, in Birbhum District in the Indian state of West Bengal, marking the harvest season. Commencing on the 7th day of the month of Poush, the fair officially lasts for three days, although vendors may stay until the month-end as per the university regulations. From 2017 onwards, the fair lasted for six days. The key characteristic of this fair include live performances of Bengali folk music, such as baul, kirtan and Kobigan.

Background
Devendranath Tagore with twenty followers accepted the Brahmo creed from Ram Chandra Vidyabagish on 21 December 1843 (7 Poush 1250 according to the Bengali calendar). This was the basis of Poush Utsav (the Festival of Poush) at Santiniketan
A Brahma mandir was established at Santiniketan on 21 December 1891 (7 Poush 1298 according to the Bengali calendar). A small fair was organised in 1894 in connection with the establishment anniversary of the Brahma mandir, in the ground opposite the mandir. What started as a small homely Poush Mela now attracts attention of not only the people of Birbhum district but tourists from all around.
From 1894 onwards, the Poush Mela has been organized every year. However it has been put on halt for three times due to the Bengal Famine of 1943, Direct Action Day of 1946 and the COVID-19 pandemic.
In earlier days the mela (fair) was held in the ground on the north side of Brahma mandir (also referred to as glass temple). On that day, a firework display was held in earlier days after evening prayers. As the mela increased in size, it was shifted to the field in Purbapalli.

Inauguration
Poush Utsav is inaugurated on 7 Poush (around 23 December). At dawn, Santiniketan wakes up to the soft music of shehnai. The first to enter the scenario is the Vaitalik group, who go round the ashrama (hermitage) singing songs. It is followed by a prayer-meeting at Chhatimtala. Then the entire congregation moves on to Uttarayan singin"
GS3,Animal sacrifice in Hinduism,"The practice of Hindu animal sacrifice is in recent times mostly associated with Shaktism, and in currents of folk Hinduism strongly rooted in local popular or tribal traditions. Animal sacrifices were part of the ancient Vedic Era in India, and are mentioned in scriptures such as the Puranas. The  Hindu scripture Brahma Vaivarta Purana forbids the Asvamedha Horse sacrifice in this Kali Yuga. However, the perception that animal sacrifice was only practiced in ancient Non-Vedic Era is opposed by instances like Ashvamedha and other rituals that are rooted in Vedas. Both the Itihasas and the Puranas like the Devi Bhagavata Purana and the Kalika Purana as well as the Saiva and Sakta Agamas prescribe animal sacrifices.

Terminology
A Sanskrit term used for animal sacrifice is bali, in origin meaning ""tribute, offering or oblation"" generically (""vegetable oblations [... and] animal oblations,""). 
Bali among other things ""refers to the blood of an animal"" and is sometimes known as Jhatka Bali among Hindus.
The Kalika Purana distinguishes bali (sacrifice), mahabali (great sacrifice), for the ritual killing of goats, elephant, respectively, though the reference to humans in Shakti theology is symbolic and done in effigy in modern times. For instance, Sir John Woodroffe published a commentary on the Karpuradistotram, where he writes that the sacrificial animals listed in verse 19 are symbols for the six enemies, with ""man"" representing pride.

Hindu scriptures
The Brahmanic texts explicitly state that five creatures were suitable for sacrifice in Vedic India, in descending order: man, horse, cattle, sheep, and goat. The text of the Rigveda and other Vedas provide detailed description of sacrifices including cattle sacrifice.
The Ashvamedha, a ritual in which a horse was allowed to roam freely for a year, then finally sacrificed, is mentioned in the Vedic texts such as the Yajurveda. In the epic Mahabharata, Yudhishtra performs the Ashwamedha after winning the Kurukshetra war "
GS3,National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development,"The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is an All India Development Financial Institution (DFI) and an apex Supervisory Body for overall supervision of Regional Rural Banks, State Cooperative Banks and District Central Cooperative Banks in India. It was established under the NABARD Act 1981 passed by the Parliament of India. It is fully owned by Government of India and functions under the Department of Financial Services (DFS) under the Ministry of Finance.

History
The importance of institutional credit in boosting rural economy has been clear to the Government of India right from its early stages of planning. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at the insistence of the Government of India, constituted a Committee to Review the Arrangements For Institutional Credit for Agriculture and Rural Development (CRAFICARD) to look into these very critical aspects. The Committee was formed on 30 March 1979, under the Chairmanship of Shri B. Sivaraman, former member of the Planning Commission, Government of India.
The Committee’s interim report, submitted on 28 November 1979, outlined the need for a new organisational device for providing undivided attention, forceful direction and pointed focus to credit related issues linked with rural development. Its recommendation was the formation of a unique development financial institution which would address these aspirations, and the formation of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was approved by the Parliament through Act 61 of 1981.
NABARD came into existence on 12 July 1982 by transferring the agricultural credit functions of RBI and refinance functions of the then Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC). It was dedicated to the service of the nation by the late Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi on 5 November 1982. Set up with an initial capital of Rs.100 crore, its paid up capital stood at Rs.14,080 crore as of 31 March 2020. Consequent to the revision "
GS3,Bargarh Main Canal,"Bargarh main canal is the main section of the Hirakud Dam starting at right bank of the dam, near Burla. This canal releases 4,000 cubic feet per second (110 m3/s) of water for irrigation and industrial usage .
The main canal then splits into two parts. The minor part traverses from Katapali towards Bargarh town and further towards Bheden block. Main part of the canal goes straight towards Barpali, Sonepur and Bolangir. Bheden block is known to be the ""tail"" area of the canal and often faces shortage of water from the irrigation system.

Construction
The construction of this canal system began during construction of Hirakud Dam in late 1950s. It now irrigates in three districts of Bargarh, Bolangir and Sonepur. The area under irrigation during summer and winter varies.

GS3,Indian wine,"The modern Indian Wine market is small but growing; annual per capita consumption of wine in the country is a mere 9 millilitres, approximately 1/8000th that of France. The main reason for this can be attributed to the fact that Indians preference for hard liquor and beer boasts nearly 98% of market share whereas wine with low ABV only has 2% market share. The viticulture in India has a long history, dating back to the time of the Indus Valley civilization when grapevines were believed to have been introduced from Persia. Winemaking has existed throughout most of India's history but was particularly encouraged during the time of the Portuguese and British colonization of the subcontinent. The end of the 19th century saw the phylloxera louse take its toll on the Indian wine industry, followed by religious and public opinion moving towards the prohibition. Following the country's independence from the British Empire, the Indian government encouraged vineyards to convert to table grape and raisin production. In the 1980s and 1990s, a revival in the Indian wine industry took place as international influences and the growing middle class started increasing demand for the beverage. By the turn of the 21st century, demand was increasing at a rate of 20-30% a year. The city of Nashik in the state of Maharashtra is called the ""Wine Capital of India"".

History
Regarding the first wines of India, historians believe that these early plantings were used mostly for table grapes or grape juice rather than the production of an alcoholic beverage. During the Vedic period of the 2nd and 1st millennia, the tribes of the region were known for their indulgence in intoxicating drink and it seems probable that wine was a current beverage. The religious text of the Vedas mentions at least one alcoholic drink that may have been wine related -sura which seems to have been a type of rice wine that was fermented with honey. The first known mention of grape-based wines was in the late 4th centu"
GS3,Farmers' suicides in western Odisha,"The Kosal region of India had been a prosperous land with abundant natural resources and a self-sufficient economy. Flooding was not a very well known occurrence in the region; however, there were many occasions of droughts.
The Hirakud Dam, as well as others, was built by the government primarily to decrease the damage by flooding in Coastal Odisha and to facilitate irrigation in the Kosal region. As most of the dams were built in Western Odisha, many villages were displaced. Moreover, the displaced people, mainly farmers, were not given compensation for damages.
The displaced people migrated to other places such as in Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Sonepur, Angul, and the Boudh district. After losing their land and not being compensated, said displaced people bought land and lived on small income generated from their small land holdings. Irrigation and rain saved these people from facing severe sustained drought. 
Forest coverage of the catchment area of Hirakud Dam which lies mostly in Chhattisgarh, has declined drastically which is evident from browsing catchment area of the Hirakud on Google Earth. Most of the perennial water sources and streams come from the Bauxite holding Mountains due to the water affinity of the mineral.  As bauxite and iron ores are being extracted, the water-holding capacity of these have declined causing siltation and flash floods during rain and drought during summer.  Adding to it unsustainable industrialization and use of water resources by Industry the irrigation in this region has suffered. High level of Pollution due to many small and large industries and indiscriminate deforestation has decreased precipitation and has increased diseases leading either to decrease in yield or loss of crop.

GS3,Genetically modified brinjal,"The genetically modified brinjal is a suite of transgenic brinjals (also known as eggplant or aubergine) created by inserting a crystal protein gene (Cry1Ac) from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into the genome of various brinjal cultivars. The insertion of the gene, along with other genetic elements such as promoters, terminators and an antibiotic resistance marker gene into the brinjal plant is accomplished using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. The Bt brinjal has been developed to give resistance against lepidopteron insects, in particular, the Brinjal Fruit and Shoot Borer (Leucinodes orbonalis)(FSB), by forming pores in the insects' digestive system. Mahyco, an Indian seed company based in Jalna, Maharashtra, has developed the Bt brinjal.
The genetically modified brinjal event is termed Event EE 1, and Mahyco has also applied for approval of two brinjal hybrids. Event EE 1 was introduced by breeding the plants into various local varieties by University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore. Some of the cultivars of Brinjal include Malpur local, Manjari gota, Kudachi local, Udupi local, 112 GO, and Pabkavi local. It was approved for commercialization in India in 2009, but - after an apparent public outcry and rounds of debates in which representatives from Mahyco, the scientific community, and NGO's spoke on the topic - the then Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, facilitated a moratorium on its release until further, unspecified, tests were conducted.

The Faculty of Agriculture (FoA) is located in Wadura, Sopore 
and the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry (F.V.Sc & A.H) campus is located in Shuhama, Alusteng, Ganderbal.

History
The university was founded in 1982 by an Act passed by the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir. It was named after Kashmiri leader Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah who is popularly known as Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir). The name given to the university was ""Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology"" (SKUAST).
Initially, the university had jurisdiction over the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir with its headquarters at Shalimar, Srinagar. When the SKUAST Act came in force, the agricultural education, research and extension training units were transferred to SKUAST from various development departments viz; Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Sheep Husbandry and Sericulture of Jammu and Kashmir State.

GS3,History of agriculture in the Indian subcontinent,"The oldest evidence for Indian agriculture is in north-west Indian subcontinent dates from the Neolithic c. 8000-6000 BCE, with traces of the cultivation of plants and domestication of crops and animals. India was the largest producer of wheat and grain. Then settled life soon followed with implements and techniques being developed for agriculture. Double monsoons led to two harvests being reaped in one year. Indian products soon reached the world via existing trading networks and foreign crops were introduced to India. Plants and animals—considered essential to their survival by the Indians—came to be worshiped and venerated.
The Middle Ages saw irrigation channels reach a new level of sophistication in India and Indian crops affecting the economies of other regions of the world. Land and water management systems were developed with an aim of providing uniform growth. Despite some stagnation during the later modern era the independent Republic of India was able to develop a comprehensive agricultural programme.

Early history
Neolithic
In the period of the Neolithic Revolution, roughly 8000-4000 BCE, Agro pastoralism in India included threshing, planting crops in rows and storing grain in granaries. Barley —either of two or of six rows— and wheat cultivation—along with the rearing of cattle, sheep and goat—was visible in Mehrgarh by 8000-6000 BCE.
According to Gangal et al. (2014), there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the Near East into north-west India. Yet, Jean-Francois Jarrige argues for an independent origin of Mehrgarh. Jarrige notes the similarities between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus valley, which are evidence of a ""cultural continuum"" between those sites. Nevertheless, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background,"" and is not a ""'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East."" Singh et al.

GS3,Wangala,"Wangala is also called the festival of ""The Hundred Drums"", a harvest festival celebrated by the Garo tribe, who live in Meghalaya, Nagaland, and Assam in India and Greater Mymensingh in Bangladesh. In this post harvest festival, they give thanks to 'Misi Saljong', the sun god, for blessing the people with a rich harvest. Wangala is celebrated in the months from September to December, with different villages setting different dates for the occasion.

History of modern Wangala
The first Hundred Drums Wangala Festival was organized on 6 and 7 December 1976 at Asanang, near the Rongram C&RD Block Office, 18 km from Tura, India. Since then, it has been celebrated every year. The festival has grown so big as to include dance troupes from outside Garo Hills such as Bangladesh and Karbi Anglong, with a sizeable amount of prize money up for grabs awarded to the best performing dance troupe. The 100 Drums Festival is a state-sponsored event, attracting many local, national and international tourists every year.

The celebrations
Wangala is traditionally celebrated for two to three days - or up to a week - by two or three collaborating villages; though recently it has been celebrated for one day in metropolitan areas as an attempt to conserve the ancient heritage of the Garo tribe and to expose the younger generation to their roots. True traditional styles of celebrating Wangala can be found in remote ""Songsarek"" (animistic) villages such as Sadolpara in West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, where people who worship the old gods still persist in their way of life; all the while rejecting Christianity. A much more hyped and  commercialised variant of Wangala can be observed in the 100 Drums Festival held at Asanang in West Garo Hills, Meghalaya, where performers (who may or may not be Christians and not Songsarek) are invited from all over Garo Hills, and even from far off places such as Karbi Anglong, Tripura and Bangladesh which have sizeable pockets of Garo inhabitants.

GS3,Redevelopment of Mumbai mills,"The redevelopment of Mumbai's cotton mills began in 1992, when efforts began to demolish the numerous cotton mills that once dotted the landscape of Mumbai, India, to make way for new residential and commercial buildings, as part of the wider redevelopment and modernization of Mumbai.

The cotton mill era and its decline
The mills of Girangaon were once integral to Mumbai's economy, particularly during the British colonial period, when Mumbai (then known as Bombay) was often referred to as the ""Manchester of the East"". However, with the development of newer industries in and around Mumbai, these mills ceased to be profitable, and fell into a state of disrepair.
In the first half of the nineteenth century, India exported cotton to Britain, and then reimported the textile. In 1820, the total textile import was valued at Rs. 350,000. However, the cost had escalated significantly by 1860, when textile imports stood at Rs. 19.3 million. The impetus towards the founding of a cotton industry came from Indian entrepreneurs. The first Indian cotton mill, ""The Bombay Spinning Mill"", was opened in 1854 in Bombay by Cowasji Nanabhai Davar. Opposition from the Lancashire mill owners was eventually offset by the support of the British manufacturers of textile machinery.
The cotton mills of Bombay, and the rest of India, were owned and managed mainly by Indians. The initial investments came from families of the mill-owners, mainly obtained from trading. Later, when shares became available to the public, much of the ownership still remained Indian – of the 53 mills in the city in 1925, only 14 were British-owned. The management and directorships of these mills were also mainly Indian; of the 386 directorships recorded in 1925, only 44 were English.
By 1870, there were 13 mills in Bombay. Cotton exports grew during the American Civil War, when supplies from the United States's cotton plantations were interrupted. At the end of 1895, there were 102 mills; growing to 136 by 1900. A pe"

GS3,Gaan-Ngai,"Gaan-Ngai is a festival of the Zeliangrong people (indigenous Zeme, Liangmei and Rongmei tribes) of Assam, Manipur and Nagaland states in North Eastern India. Gaan-Ngai is a festival of light, celebrating the victory of light over evil and the commemoration of the coming of light or fire. It is a post harvest festival celebrated to thank the God Tingkao Ragwang for a good harvest season and heralds the beginning of a new year. The festival is celebrated for five days with various rituals, prayers and festivities such as music, dance and feast accompanying the same.

Etymology
Gaan-Ngai translates to ""winter festival"" in the Zemeic languages with Gaan meaning ""winter"" or ""dry season"" and Ngai meaning festival.

Background
According to legend and folklore, life began after the creation of the universe including earth by Tingkao Ragwang, the creator and almighty god. Gods and humans shared a common dormitory called khangchu in the house of Tingpu Rengsonnang, where they were not on friendly terms and men were often at the mercy of gods. Later, some of the men appeared in the physical form of khodiai (bee) and bit the gods, which led to the gods fleeing away.
Cooked rice on paddy plants was granted to be readily consumed as a food. There was abundance of rice, so that there was always surplus after consumption. While humans achieved peace initially, they multiplied as ages passed and the cooked rice was no more available post the fleeing of the gods. Thingpu Rengsonnang, the householder of the dormitory, visited the surroundings and found fertile soil, conducive for vegetation and proclaimed that the villagers should go for cultivation. As only raw rice could be obtained from paddy, they prayed to Tingkao Rangwang for help. After a long time of prayers, they saw smoke emanating from the ground, which was generated from a earthen pot in which a fire was burning. The fire was used to cook the raw rice and the humans were able to consume cooked rice again. The festival is "

GS3,India's Agriculture Development Problem: Lack of Access to Credit,"In India's Agriculture  Problem: Lack of Access to Credit is one of the most pressing issues that hinder India’s rural population from progress. It means the lack of access to credit by a farmer. Farmer’s suicide within the agricultural sector does not occur as a shocking matter as the farmers are deprived of monetary assistance when they are most in need.
A farmer's cries for help have been ignored as the damaging effects from the absence of credit loans tickles down the population. Apart from the healthcare of a farmer, the lack of access to credit also highly important as almost 80% the farmers own less than a hectare of land. The availability of credit allows farmers to be protected from the inflated costs faced in agriculture and also, improve the quality of fertilizers and hence the output. Should the distribution of credit loans improve, the Indian government would also find it easy to meet production targets and have a better control over prices of grains. Due to the critical shortage of agricultural output, India has to resort to banning grain exports and instead, drive up its import bills from wheat coming into the country. There has been so much attention focused on the industrial and services sector that the agricultural side has been largely neglected. The lack of credit loans coupled with improper government intervention had resulted in the livelihood of the farmers to go downhill.
As commercial banks are not present in remote locations of India, where agriculture is supposed to thrive, it becomes an important limitation as the rural population has a strong dependence on it. Co-operative banks which have been set up previously were also doomed to fail as a result of bad loans and a lack of funds. These commercial banks have their own set of worries, as defaults and crop failures are common in the sector. As such, they prefer lending out to areas where each farmer owns a much larger proportion of land and also, have better irrigation systems.

GS3,Sugar industry of India,"Sugar has been produced in India since ancient 1200BC and then it spread to other parts. Sugarcane is a native of tropical Indian and Pakistan subcontinent then to Southeast Asia. In India, sugarcane is planted thrice a year in October, March and July depending on part of the country.  Most of the sugar production in India takes at local Cooperative Sugar mills. After gaining Independence, India made serious plans for overall industrial development of sugar industry.

Market
Sugar industry is a big business in India. Around 525 mills produced more than 30 million tonnes of sugar in the last crushing season, which lasted from October to April. This makes it the world's largest producer, unseating Brazil. Some 50 million farmers and millions of more workers, are involved in sugarcane farming. India is the world's largest consumer of sugar. According to data from the Indian Sugar Mills Association, the country's sugar mill produce 268.21 lakh (26,821,000) tonnes of sugar between October 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020.
On May 24, 2022, the Indian government announced that India will restrict the export of sugar from June 1, 2022. This restriction has been ordered to maintain domestic availability and ensure price stability.

Production of sugar cane in India
Sugar cane is very important input for making sugar. When production of sugar cane increases, sugar production also increases. Sugar cane's production increased from 110 million tonnes in year 1961 to 405 million tonnes in year 2019. Sugar cane are grown in 2413 thousand hectare in 1961 year to 5061 thousand hectare in year 2019. Production quality for sugar cane is also increased. Production quantity improved from 45 tonnes/hectare to 80 tonnes/hectare.

Production of sugar cane by state
Traditionally, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra produce the majority of sugar cane in India. This can be attributed to rich soil surrounding major rivers present in both states. However, in 2019 Maharashtra was hit with floods thus affecti"
GS3,Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region,"Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCD-NER) is a central sector scheme under the Government of India's organic scheme which aims at development of organic value chains in the North East Region of India. The scheme is being implemented in all eight states of the North East India namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura since 2015-16.

The scheme entails creation of 100 FPO/FPC across the eight states comprising a total area of 50000 hectare. As of 2018, 50,000 farmers have been engaged under the scheme. The scheme provides support to the complete value chain through inputs, seeds, organic certification, creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing, marketing and brand building initiative. Organic certification of the land under the FPOs is done by a third-party certification body under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP), which is mandatory for exports.

Background
India’s North-East region has witnessed a very limited use of agro-chemicals with farmers using traditional methods and on-farm inputs for farming. The region is also characterized by a diverse agro-ecological zones, variable terrain and sufficient rainfall to support a wide variety of fruit, grain and spice crops. The organic credentials of the region received a boost in the year 2016 when Sikkim was declared India’s first organic state by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. MOVCD-NER scheme was conceptualized to explore this untapped potential for organic in the region.

It was created through the Frieswal Project, a collaboration between Military Farms Service and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Central Institute for Research on Cattle (ICAR-CIRC). The breed was created by crossing the Holstein Friesian with the indigenous Sahiwal to improve milk production while retaining adaptability to India's diverse climates. The breed was developed to improve milk production while maintaining adaptability to India's diverse climatic conditions.

History
The Frieswal project was initiated to produce a high-yielding dairy breed capable of producing 4000 kg of milk with 4% butterfat over a 300-day lactation period. The project spans 37 Military Farms across various agro-climatic zones of India, ensuring the breed's adaptability nationwide. The cattle are selectively bred through inter se mating and progeny testing of elite cows and proven bulls.
In 2018, the Indian Army closed 15 military farms and sold 16,000 Frieswal cows to various states at a nominal price of ₹1,000 each as part of efforts to streamline resources and improve operational efficiency.

Career as a pilot
Captain V. Sundaram became a pilot in 1935 at the age of 19. He trained in England and returned to India to become an instructor at the Madras Flying Club. He flew extensively over the country, and was probably the first person to take a picture of the Taj Mahal from air. During World War II, he trained British and American pilots. In 1945 he joined Tata Airlines, and from 1945 to 1951, served as the pilot of the Maharaja of Mysore. During this time he flew Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel throughout India, especially the latter when he was negotiating the merger of princely states with India. His wife, Usha Sundaram, served as co-pilot in many of these flights. They set a world record for flying a de Havilland Dove from London to Madras in 27 hours. This record for a piston-engined aircraft is still unbroken. Captain Sundaram had an accident-free flying record during the 35 years he served as pilot. He wrote of his experiences as a pilot in a book titled An Airman's Saga.
Sundaram was the first pilot to get the commercial pilot licence in the country. On 26 October 1936, he flew a De Havilland Dove aircraft from Karachi to Madras.

Animal welfare
Captain V. Sundaram was always known for his compassion for animals. It was known among pilots that he would keep circling around until the runway was cleared of stray animals. He was instrumental in stopping animal sacrifices at several places. He also organized several seminars speaking against cruel methods of killing animals.

GS3,Animal welfare and rights in India,"Animal welfare and rights in India regards the treatment of and laws concerning non-human animals in India. It is distinct from animal conservation in India.
India is home to several religious traditions advocating non-violence and compassion towards animals, and has passed a number of animal welfare reforms since 1960. India is also one of the world's leading producers of animal products.

History
Ancient India
The Vedas, the first scriptures of Hinduism (originating in the second millennium BCE), teach ahimsa or nonviolence towards all living beings.  In Hinduism, killing an animal is regarded as a violation of ahimsa and causes bad karma, leading many Hindus to practice vegetarianism.  Hindu teachings do not require vegetarianism, however, and allow animal sacrifice in rare religious ceremonies.
Jainism was founded in India in the 7th-5th century BCE, and ahimsa is its central teaching.  Due to their belief in the sanctity of all life, Jains practice strict vegetarianism and many go to great lengths even to avoid harming insects.
Buddhism is the third major religion to emerge in India, and its teachings also include ahimsa.  Buddhism teaches vegetarianism (though not as strictly as Jainism), and many Buddhists practice life release in which animals destined for slaughter are purchased and released to the wild. Despite the influence of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, meat-eating was still common in ancient India.
In 262 BCE, the Mauryan king Ashoka converted to Buddhism.  For the remainder of his reign, he issued edicts informed by the Buddhist teachings of compassion for all beings.  These edicts included the provision of medical treatment for animals and bans on animal sacrifice, the castration of roosters, and hunting of many species.

GS3,Cooperative sugar factories in Maharashtra,"Sugarcane is a primary cash crop among farmers of the western Maharashtra region. The sugarcane is mostly sold to sugar mills for sugar production. Majority of these mills are cooperatives owned by the sugarcane growers. Solapur district has highest number of sugar factories in Maharashtra.

History
The cooperative movement for the sugar industry started in the 1960s in Maharashtra with the announcement of 12 places in the state where sugar factories could be established. The then Bombay state government announced a capital share of one million rupees to establish sugar factories at these potential 12 places. A central committee was formed by Bombay State Cooperative Bank under the chairmanship of economist Dhananjayrao Gadgil.
Asia's first cooperative sugar factory was established at Pravaranagar in the Ahmednagar District of the then Bombay state in 1950  by Vithalrao Vikhe Patil, & Gadgil. The sugar mill, called Pravara Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd, had majority ownership by the local farmers.

Sugar cooperatives and State politics
Over the last sixty years, the local sugar mills have played a crucial part in encouraging rural political participation and as a stepping stone for aspiring politicians. In Maharashtra there are a large number of politicians belonging to the Congress or NCP with ties to sugar cooperatives from their respective local areas.  Unfortunately, mismanagement and manipulation of the cooperative principles has made a number of these operations inefficient.

Present scenario
In 2016,  there were 173 cooperative sugar factories in operation. Maharashtra accounts for 20% of sugar production in India  behind Uttar Pradesh at 24%. The presence of this industry has led to development of rural places, from which the sugarcane is drawn to factories, including an improved road network, transportation facilities, medical facilities, education facilities, and banking.
Sugar mills in Maharashtra produced just over 100,000 tons of sugar in 2017-18 season,"

Some johads also have bricked or stones masonry and cemented ghat (series of steps and/or ramp).
Rainwater fills the pit. These are connected to other small pits like this. The extra rainwater is filled in the smaller pits. They are then used for cleaning, drinking and washing purposes.
Johads also cater to resident and seasonal migrant birds as well as wildlife animals from the nearby bani (forest). State fisheries departments also promote the use of these johads for raising fishes on contract basis for commercial fishing. Johads are often seen surrounded by embankment, with water well and trees around them. In many parts, specially in dry state of Rajasthan, the annual rainfall is very low (between 450 and 600 mm) and the water can be unpleasant to drink. Rainfall during July and August is stored in johads and used throughout the year.

GS3,Agriculture in ancient Tamil country,"During the Sangam age, 700 BCE – 100 CE, agriculture was the main vocation of the Tamil. It was considered a necessity for life, and hence was treated as  the foremost among all occupations. The farmers or the Ulavar were placed right at the top of the social classification. As they were the producers of food grains, they lived with self-respect. Agriculture during the early stages of Sangam period was primitive, but it progressively got more efficient with improvements in irrigation, ploughing, manuring, storage and distribution.
The ancient Tamils were aware of the different varieties of soil, the kinds of crops that can be grown on them and the various irrigation schemes suitable for a given region. These were also in Madras, Thanjore (now as Chennai, Thanjavur respectively).

Land classification
Among the five geographical divisions of the Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands on the basis of fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and they knew what crops coul"
GS3,Farmers' suicides in India,"Farmers' suicides in India refers to the event of farmers dying by suicide in India since the 1970s, due to their inability to repay loans mostly taken from private landlords and banks. India being an agrarian country with around 70% of its rural population depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture, the sector had a 15% share in the economy of India in 2023, and according to NSSO, around 45.5% of country's labor force was associated with agriculture in 2022.  Activists and scholars have offered several conflicting reasons for farmer suicides, such as anti-farmer laws, high debt burdens, poor government policies, corruption in subsidies, crop failure, mental health, personal issues and family problems.
The National Crime Records Bureau data shows that while 296,438 farmers had died by suicide between 1995 and 2014, in the nine years between 2014 and 2022, the number stood at 100,474. In 2022, a total of 11,290 persons involved in the farming sector (5,207 farmers and 6,083 agricultural labourers) have committed suicide in India, accounting for 6.6% of total suicide victims in the country.
Earlier, governments had reported varying figures, from 5,650 farmer suicides in 2014 to the highest number of farmer suicides in 2004 of 18,241. The farmer's suicide rate in India had ranged between 1.4 and 1.8 per 1,00,000 population, over a 10-year period through 2005. However, the figures in 2017 and 2018 showed an average of more than 10 suicides daily or 5760 suicides per year. There are accusations of states manipulating the data on farmer suicides, hence the real figures could be even higher.

Historical records relating to frustration, revolts, and high mortality rates among farmers in India, particularly cash crop farmers, date back to the 19th century. However, suicides due to the same were rare. The high land taxes of the 1870s, payable in cash regardless of the effects of frequent famines on farm output or productivity, combined with colonial protection "
GS3,Kilvenmani massacre,"The Kilvenmani massacre (or Keezhvenmani massacre) was an incident in Kizhavenmani village, Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu state in India on 25 December 1968 in which a group of around 44 people, the families of striking Dalit village labourers, were murdered by a gang, allegedly led by their landlords. The chief accused was Gopalakrishnan Naidu.
It became a notable event in left wing political campaigns of the time and in Communist ideology. The incident helped to initiate large-scale changes in the local rural economy, engendering a massive redistribution of land in the region.

Massacre
The incident occurred when some poor labourers were influenced by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to organise themselves into a campaign for higher wages following the increase in agricultural production as the result of the Green Revolution in India.
The lands were controlled by powerful families, while the labourers were from a marginalized community. In 1968, the agricultural labourers of unified Tanjore district formed a union seeking better working conditions and higher wages. To mark their union the workers hoisted red flags in their villages, irking their landlords. The landlords formed a separate union with yellow flags and started laying off workers belonging to the Communist unions.
This led to tensions and finally a boycott by all labourers. The peasants withheld part of the harvest as a negotiating tactic. The Paddy Producers Association, representing the local landlords, organised external labourers to continue the harvest. Matters became fraught when a local shopkeeper who supported the protesters was kidnapped by supporters of the landlords and beaten up. Protesters attacked the kidnappers, forcing them to release their hostage. In the clash, one of the landlords' agents was killed.

According to eyewitness accounts, on 25 December 1968, at around 10 p.m., the landlords and their 200 henchmen came in lorries and surrounded the hutments, cutting off all r"
GS3,Chipko movement,"The Chipko movement (Hindi: चिपको आन्दोलन, lit. 'hugging movement') is a forest conservation movement in India. Opposed to commercial logging and the government's policies on deforestation, protesters in the 1970s engaged in tree hugging, wrapping their arms around trees so that they could not be felled.
Today, beyond its eco-socialist reputation, the movement is seen increasingly as an ecofeminist one. Although many of its leaders were men, women had a much more significant participation, as they were the ones most affected by the rampant deforestation, which led to a lack of firewood and fodder as well as water for drinking and irrigation. Over the years they also became primary stakeholders in a majority of the afforestation work that happened under the Chipko movement. In 1987, the Chipko movement was awarded the Right Livelihood Award ""for its dedication to the conservation, restoration and ecologically-sound use of India's natural resources"".

Background
Inspired by Karan Singh and the Jyoti Kumari movement, in the year 1964 Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh (""Dasholi Society for Village Self-Rule""), was set up by Gandhian social worker Chandi Prasad Bhatt in Chamoli Gopeshwar, with an aim to set up small industries using the resources of the forest. Their first project was a small workshop making farm tools for local use. Its name was later changed to DGSM from the original Dashauli Gram Swarajya Sangh (DGSS) in the 1980s. Here they had to face restrictive forest policies, a hangover of colonial era still prevalent, as well as the ""contractor system"", in which these pieces of forest land were commodified and auctioned to big contractors, usually from the plains, who brought along their own skilled and semi-skilled laborers, leaving only the menial jobs like hauling rocks for the hill people, and paying them next to nothing. On the other hand, the hill regions saw an influx of more people from the outside, which only added to the already strained ecological balance."
GS3,Agera (festival),"Agera (East Indian: आगेरा) is a thanksgiving harvest festival celebrated by the Roman Catholic community of Mumbai primarily the Bombay East Indians. This festival is also celebrated in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Vasai.
This traditional harvest festival is held in the beginning of October, when the grain would be ready for harvest, and lasted for five days. This Festival was celebrated by East Indian families all over Mumbai.
This festival would commence with the priest in every community, going down to the fields to bless the newly harvested crop and giving thanks to God, along with the farmers and villagers. 
After coming together in prayer, the community would celebrate with delicious food, singing and dance.

Etymology
The word Agera is derived from Latin words Ager which means field or farm and Agricola which means Farmer

Date
Agera falls on the first Sunday of October. It is normally called the Harvest festival where farmers cut the crops and offer the first fruits to God. It is normally seen throughout India where different communities celebrate this festive in their own ways.

Celebrations
The East Indians were the people who were engaged in agricultural activities. In the observed festival, paddy is harvested and subsequently brought to local churches in a ceremonial procession. This procession is characteristically accompanied by the East Indian Band. Members of the Catholic community transport the paddy on horse-drawn or bullock carts, culminating in its presentation at the church. Upon arrival, priests bestow blessings upon the harvest. Following the religious services, the blessed harvest is distributed to the households in attendance. The festival culminates with East Indian cultural events held in various villages, including Kurla, Marol, and others.

GS3,Ambubachi Mela,"The Ambubachi Mela () is an annual Hindu mela (gathering) held at Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, Assam. This yearly mela is celebrated during the monsoon season that happens to fall during the Assamese month Ahaar, around the middle of June when the sun transits to the zodiac of Mithuna, when the Brahmaputra River is in spate. During this time Brahmaputra River near the temple turns Red for three days. 
Ambubachi Mela is the celebration of the yearly menstruation course of goddess Kamakhya. It is believed that the presiding goddess of the temple, Devi Kamakhya, the Mother Shakti, goes through her annual cycle of menstruation during this time stretch. It is also believed that during the monsoon rains, the creative and nurturing power of the 'menses' of Mother Earth becomes accessible to devotees at this site during the mela. There is no idol of the presiding deity but she is worshipped in the form of a yoni-like stone instead over which a natural spring flows.

Tantric fertility festival
This mela is also known as Ameti or Tantric fertility festival since it is closely associated with Tantric Shakti cult prevalent in eastern parts of India. Even some Tantric Babas make their public appearances only during these four days. The rest of the year, they remain in seclusion. Some Babas are seen displaying their psychic powers like putting their heads in a pit and stand upright on it, or standing on one leg for hours at a stretch.

The mela
The temple remains closed for three days during the mela for it is believed that Goddess Kamakhya rests for three days like the traditional women's menstrual seclusion. During these three days some restrictions are observed by the devotees like not cooking, not performing puja or reading holy books, no farming etc. After three days, the Goddess is bathed and other rituals are performed to ensure that Goddess Kamakhya is back to her original form. Then the doors of the temple are reopened and prasad is distributed. On the fourth day the dev"
GS3,Kisan Long March,"Kisan Rally or Kisan Long March was a large scale protest march by farmers in the Indian state of Maharashtra, organized by the All India Kisan Sabha, the peasants front of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Around 60,000 to 70,000 farmers marched a distance of 200  km from Nashik to Mumbai to gherao the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha. The peaceful march came to a conclusion on March 12, 2018, after the Government of Maharashtra gave assurances for fulfillment of said demands. These assurances however, were not executed which resulted in Kisan Long March 2 which commenced on February 27, 2019, but was suspended soon after.

Background
The farming sector in the state of Maharashtra was badly affected by numerous factors including unseasonal rainfalls, hailstorm, and pest infestations. An estimated 2414 farmers had taken their lives in the state between January 1 and October 31, 2017. Considering these issues, among others, the government had announced a conditional loan waiver amounting to Rs 34,000 crore in 2017, but it was not implemented as promised.
The long march was inspired and led by the Kisan Sabha leaders Ajit Nawale, Ashok Dhawale, Jiva Pandu Gavit and Vijoo Krishnan.

GS3,Mahalwari,"The Mahalwari system was used in India to protect village-level-autonomy. It was introduced by Holt Mackenzie  in 1822. The word ""Mahalwari"" is derived from the Hindi word Mahal, which means a community made from one or more villages.. Mahalwari consisted of landlords or Lambardars (also called as Nambardars) assigned to represent villages or groups of villages. Along with the village communities, the landlords were jointly responsible for the payment of revenue . Revenue was determined on basis of the produce of Mahal. Individual responsibility was not assigned. The land included under this system consisted of all land in the villages, including forestland, pastures etc. This system was prevalent in parts of the Gangetic Valley, Uttar Pradesh, the North Western province, parts of Central India and Punjab.
The other two systems were the Permanent Settlement in Bengal in 1793 and the Ryotwari system in 1820. It covered the states of Punjab, Awadh and Agra, parts of Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh.

History
During the 1800s, the British established control over the administrative machinery of India. The System of Land Revenue acted as a chief source of income for the British. Thus, they used land to control the entire Revenue system, strengthening their economic condition in India.
The North-Western Provinces and Oudh (Awadh) were two important territories acquired by the East India Company in modern Uttar Pradesh. In 1801, the Nawab of Awadh surrendered the districts of Allahabad to the Company. The [Jamuna] and the Ganges valleys were acquired by the British after the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Governor-General of Bengal, Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings conquered more territories of North India after the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1820.

He was a well known surveyor of the early British hill stations in South India and a famous sportsman, shikari, big-game hunter and trophy collector. He was an acute observer of nature and a gentleman. He legitimately shot more game in the Nilgiri Hills than any other sportsman.

Family
Hamilton was born on 8 April 1818, and educated at Harrow School.
He was the youngest of eight sons of Charles Hamilton esq. of Sudbury Grove house, Middlesex - not far from Harrow on the Hill - and of Kensworth House, Hertfordshire. His father was employed at the War Office and died on 28 June 1834 aged 56.

Hamilton's brother Edward was the editor of his 1892 autobiography, ""Records of sport in southern India chiefly on the Annamullay, Nielgherry and Pulney mountains, also including notes on Singapore, Java and Labuan, ..."" This is about ""years long gone by when the muzzle loader, with all its drawbacks, was the chief weapon in use."" His brother Richard, a Captain in the 1st Regiment M.N.I., was well known to all Southern Indian sportsmen as the author of Game under the soubriquet of "" Hawkeye.""

ShoreBank had branches in Chicago's South and West sides, Cleveland, and Detroit. Between 2000 and 2006, ShoreBank issued nearly $900 million in loans to citizens in Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland. ShoreBank and its affiliated companies had projects in 30 countries.
ShoreBank incorporated environmental conservation into its mission during the 1990s, helping develop a triple bottom line approach to banking, equally prioritizing profits, impact on people, and the impact of a project on the environment. At that time it established ShoreBank Pacific based in Portland, Oregon. 
ShoreBank accepted mission-based deposits from across the country through its Development Deposits program, launched in 1982, and its online savings account ShoreBank Direct, launched in 2007.
Although mission-based, the bank's financial performance historically matched or exceeded that of its peer banks. However, the bank faced significant losses in 2009, and as of May 2010, was seeking $200 million in additional capital from major investors and the U.S. government. The bank's losses were related to the recession, though it was not engaged in subprime lending. In the spring of 2010, ShoreBank raised over $150MM in private equity to recapitalize the bank. However, no action was taken on its application for $70MM in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds which it was fully eligible to receive.

GS4,Corporate sustainability,"Corporate sustainability is an approach aiming to create long-term stakeholder value through the implementation of a business strategy that focuses on the ethical, social, environmental, cultural, and economic dimensions of doing business. The strategies created are intended to foster longevity, transparency, and proper employee development within business organizations. Firms will often express their commitment to corporate sustainability through a statement of Corporate Sustainability Standards (CSS), which are usually policies and measures that aim to meet, or exceed, minimum regulatory requirements.
Corporate sustainability is often confused with corporate social responsibility (CSR), though the two are not the same. Bansal and DesJardine (2014) state that the notion of 'time' discriminates sustainability from CSR and other similar concepts. Whereas ethics, morality, and norms permeate CSR, sustainability only obliges businesses to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. Short-termism is the bane of sustainability.

Origin
The phrase is derived from the concept of ""sustainable development"" and Elkington's (1997) ""triple bottom line."" The Brundtland Commission's Report, Our Common Future, defined sustainable development as ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:

""the concept of 'needs', in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
""the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.""
The idea of meeting present economic needs without reducing the ability of future generations to meet their own economic needs became a popular approach in the business world's implementation of sustainable development, referred to as ""corporate sustainable development.""

GS4,Sustainable product development,"Sustainable product development (SPD) is a method for product development that incorporates t he Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), also known as The Natural Step (TNS). Incorporating sustainability aspects early on in the product development process has been claimed to offer competitive advantage.

Scope
SPD includes both product development and product design. Design has two main goals: preventing waste and minimizing environmental impact. 
Environmental impact involves deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, resource/material management, etc. Resource acquisition (extraction and refining) tends to be the activity that most affects the environment. Use of renewable and recyclable materials can diminish pollution and waste. Conserving and avoiding resource use (e.g., water), and adopting renewable energy improve sustainability.

History
SPD originates from the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the 1987 Brundtland Report, Our Common Future, and the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Improvement.

Established as a bank for co-operators and co-operatives following the principles of the Rochdale Pioneers, the business evolved in the 20th century into a mid-sized British high street bank, operating throughout the UK mainland. Transactions took place at cash desks in Co-op stores until the 1960s, when the bank set up a small network of branches that grew from six to a high of 160; in 2023 it had 50 branches.
The Co-operative Bank is the only UK high street bank with a customer-led ethical policy which is incorporated into the bank's articles of association. The policy was introduced in 1992 and incorporated into the bank's constitution in 2013, then revised and expanded in 2015 in line with over 320,000 customer responses to a poll.
Despite its name, the bank has never been a cooperative itself. In the 1970s it was registered as a separate PLC that was wholly owned by the co-operative society it was part of, in order to achieve its status as a bank among other banks entitled to use inter-banking systems. That society, The Co-operative Group, maintains some relationship with the bank, including managing the licensed use of the brand name ""Co-operative ..."".

The Co-operative Group, which had previously owned the bank outright, became a minority shareholder with a 20% stake. Following restructuring and the formation of a new holding company on 1 September 2017, the Co-operative Group no longer had a stake in the bank and the relationship agreement between the two organisations ended in 2020.

GS4,Community development bank,"A community development bank (CDB) or Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) is a development bank or credit union that focus on serving people who have been locked out of the traditional financial systems such as the unbanked or underbanked in deprived local communities.  They emphasize the long term development of communities and provide loans such as micro-finance or venture capital.
In the United States these became popular after 1994 when the US Congress created community development banks and allowed them to get funding at very low rates from the US treasury.

In the United States
In the United States, community development banks are commercial banks that operate with a mission to generate economic development in low- to moderate-income (LMI) geographical areas and serve residents of these communities. In the United States, community development banks are certified as such by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, a department within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Organizers wishing to start a new CDB can seek a state or national bank charter.

GS4,Greyston Bakery,"Greyston Bakery was founded in Riverdale, New York, by Bernie Glassman, a Zen Buddhist.  Although it is a for-profit company, its profits go to its non-profit parent organization, the Greyston Foundation, where they are used on behalf of the local community.

History
The bakery was founded in 1982. Later that decade, Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's ice cream company agreed to purchase Greyston Bakery brownies for chocolate fudge brownie ice cream. In 2004, Greyston Bakery moved to a larger facility designed by Maya Lin to accommodate growth. In 2012, Greyston Bakery became New York State's first registered benefit corporation.

Social mission
The company aims to hire the hard-to-employ and is known for its ""open hiring"" practices, where anyone can sign up regardless of background. All profit from the company go to the Greyston Foundation, which uses it for low-income housing, day care open to the community, a medical center for those with AIDS, and other community endeavors.
The hiring process at the bakery is via a first-come, first-served waiting list. There are no background checks or interviews. When a name gets to the top of the list after a number of months, that person is offered a paid apprenticeship, initially at slightly above minimum wage. The apprenticeship lasts six or more months, as required to train the employee. At the successful completion of the apprenticeship (reached by about 40% of new hirees), the employee is given a permanent position. The company claims that apprentice training costs them $1,900 per employee, compared to $1,400 typically spent in recruiting and vetting expenses, and that employee turnover is comparable with other businesses in the industry.
Greyston has a social worker on-site to assist employees solve problems, such as transportation issues, child care, and housing, which may interfere with their work.

GS4,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion","In the United States, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are organizational frameworks that seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination based on identity or disability. These three notions (diversity, equity, and inclusion) together represent ""three closely linked values"" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks. The concepts predate this terminology and other variations sometimes include terms such as belonging, justice, and accessibility. As such, frameworks such as inclusion and diversity (I&D), diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB), justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI or EDIJ), or diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (IDEA, DEIA or DEAI) exist. In the United Kingdom, the term equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is used in a similar way.
Diversity refers to the presence of variety within the organizational workforce in characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, culture, class, veteran status, or religion. Equity refers to concepts of fairness and justice, such as fair compensation and substantive equality. More specifically, equity usually also includes a focus on societal disparities and allocating resources and ""decision making authority to groups that have historically been disadvantaged"", and taking ""into consideration a person's unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal."" Finally, inclusion refers to creating an organizational culture that creates an experience where ""all employees feel their voices will be heard"", and a sense of belonging and integration.
DEI often describes certain training efforts, such as diversity training. Although DEI is best known as a form of corporate training, it also finds implementation within many types of organizations, such as within academia, schools, and ho"

GS4,Solight Design,"Solight Design is an American company that manufactures portable solar lanterns intended to provide lighting in disaster areas and to people who otherwise have no access to electricity. It was co-founded by architecture professor Alice Min Soo Chun. She designed the company's signature product, the SolarPuff lantern, which is based on an earlier product created by Chun and some of her students at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture.

Products
Solight Design offers portable, cube-shaped, water-resistant solar lanterns that fold flat when not in use.  The high-end version is the SolarPuff solar lantern, while the more economical version is the SolarHelix solar lantern.
Each lantern includes a solar panel, a rechargeable lithium polymer battery, and 10 LEDs.  Exposing the solar panel to bright sunlight for about 8 hours charges the battery.  A button on the lantern switches between off, low, high and blinking.  A fully charged lantern can provide 100 lumens of light  for up to 8–12 hours.  The SolarPuff lantern (expanded 4.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches, 2.9 oz (shipping weight 3.2 oz.), flat pack to 0.25 inches) is larger than the SolarHelix lantern (expanded 4.3 x. 4.3 x.4.3 inches, 3 oz (shipping weight 3.5 oz.), flat pack to 0.5 inches).  The SolarPuff lantern's material, that functions as a light diffuser, is very high quality sailcloth used for upscale ship sails.  The Solar Helix lantern's material is flexible, recyclable TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane).

History
Solight Design's co-founder, Alice Chun, is an architecture professor interested in solar-powered light.  As explained in Chun's 2016 TEDx talk, in dealing with her son's asthma –about 10% of children in New York have asthma –Chun realized that poor air quality caused by pollutants was a growing problem, motivating Chun to find ways to incorporate solar power into daily living.  In 2008, Chun made experimental inflatable units having a solar panel, battery, LEDs, and fabric light diffuser; these experim"
GS4,Pepe (textiles),"Pepe may refer to secondhand clothes that are commonly worn by its population in Haiti. These clothes are usually sent from the United States. The Haitian textile industry has suffered due to the widespread popularity of pepe. There have even been discussions about banning the import of pepe. However, this is unlikely since the general population continues to wear pepe, which include many brand names that otherwise would be inaccessible.

History
The import of pepe began in the 1960s, during the Kennedy administration, leading to the moniker ""Kennedy clothes"". Since the 1980s, hundreds of tons of pepe has been imported, usually packaged in huge bales. The clothes are so affordable, that a used boy's t-shirt from the United States could be sold for as little as thirteen cents in Haiti. Furthermore, at an affordable cost, local seamstresses make modifications to the clothing.
In recent years, Haiti has seen an increase in the amount of clothing coming from the United States as a result of fast fashion.

GS4,Together for Sustainability,"Together for Sustainability AISBL (TfS) is a joint initiative of chemical companies, founded in 2011. It focuses on the promotion of sustainability practices in the chemical industry's supply chain, currently gathering chemical companies around a single standard of auditing and assessment.

Sustainability in chemical supply chains
Over the past few years sustainability aspects in the chemical industry have become more important and holistic. Nowadays, chemical companies' measures focusing sustainability include apart from ecological aspects also social concerns and collaborative issues.
Today, it has been well accepted that the creation of sustainable chemical supply chains requires a joint effort beyond individual businesses. These efforts should integrate chemical companies, suppliers, customers as well as consumers.
Prof. Dr Wolfgang Stolze and Marc Müller of the University of St. Gallen summarize the development in the chemical industry in recent years as follows: ""The scope of sustainability in the chemical industry has evolved from a firm-level construct with a strong focus on green aspects to a chain-level approach attempting to address the triple bottom line of economic, social and environmental elements.""

History
The Together for Sustainability initiative was founded in 2011 by BASF, Bayer, Evonik, Henkel, Lanxess, and Solvay. The objective was to develop a global supplier engagement program and improve their own sustainability sourcing practices in line with the United Nations Global Compact. Since January 2015, the TfS initiative is incorporated as an international non-profit association according to the Belgian law.
Since June 2012, TfS conducts assessments and audits by independent experts, as well as the early partnership with the French company EcoVadis, which provided with sustainability scorecards and benchmarks.
In June 2023, Jennifer Jewson, CPO of LyondellBasell, was elected as president of the TfS.

GS4,Corporate social responsibility,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) or corporate social impact is a form of international private business self-regulation which aims to contribute to societal goals of a philanthropic, activist, or charitable nature by engaging in, with, or supporting professional service volunteering through pro bono programs, community development, administering monetary grants to non-profit organizations for the public benefit, or to conduct ethically oriented business and investment practices. While CSR could have previously been described as an internal organizational policy or a corporate ethic strategy, similar to what is now known today as environmental, social, and governance (ESG), that time has passed as various companies have pledged to go beyond that or have been mandated or incentivized by governments to have a better impact on the surrounding community. In addition, national and international standards, laws, and business models have been developed to facilitate and incentivize this phenomenon. Various organizations have used their authority to push it beyond individual or industry-wide initiatives. In contrast, it has been considered a form of corporate self-regulation for some time, over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organizations to mandatory schemes at regional, national, and international levels. Moreover, scholars and firms are using the term ""creating shared value"", an extension of corporate social responsibility, to explain ways of doing business in a socially responsible way while making profits (see the detailed review article of Menghwar and Daood, 2021).
Considered at the organisational level, CSR is generally understood as a strategic initiative that contributes to a brand's reputation. As such, social responsibility initiatives must coherently align with and be integrated into a business model to be successful. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance "

The company is a certified B-Corporation indicating they adhere to the principles of the circular economy. MUD Jeans utilizes up to 40% post-consumer recycled content in its jeans, with the material sourced from discarded denim. This discarded denim comes from MUD Jeans customers, who can send their old jeans to the brand for free. Another system used aside from regular purchasing, customers can also lease their jeans for a monthly fee, over a one-year period. After one year, customers can either keep their jeans, switch them for a new pair at a 10% monthly discount or return them for recycling or upcycling.
MUD Jeans uses specific production methods to reduce the environmental impact of the production of their jeans. Through reverse osmosis, their jeans manufacturing partner recycles 95% of the water used during production. Through the dry indigo method, their fabric manufacturing partner replaces traditional dyeing methods, which typically involves multiple dyeing baths, with a high pressure and  dyeing foam application. To measure the exact environmental impact of their jeans, MUD Jeans carries out an annual Life-cycle assessment on each of their products. Through this, they communicate the water and CO2 impact of their products on their website. This concept, known as Lease A Jeans, was launched in 2013 and includes free repair services.

History
The company was re-launched by Bert van Son after acquiring the brand in 2012. Bert van Son had a new vision for the company and decided to invest in MUD Jeans.

The concept was further expanded in the January 2011 follow-up piece entitled Creating Shared Value: Redefining Capitalism and the Role of the Corporation in Society. Written by Michael E. Porter, a leading authority on competitive strategy and head of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School, and Mark R. Kramer, of the Kennedy School at Harvard University and co-founder of FSG, the article provides insights and relevant examples of companies that have developed deep links between their business strategies and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Porter and Kramer define shared value as ""the policies and practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing social and economic conditions in the communities in which it operates"",: 6  while a review published in 2021 defines the concept as ""a strategic process through which corporations can turn social problems into business opportunities"".
Menghwar and Daood (2021) conducted a comprehensive review published in the International Journal of Management Reviews ranked second best journal in the field of management in year 2022. In this article, they further refine three characteristics of creating shared value and define CSV as ""a strategic process through which corporations can solve a social problem which is relevant to its value chain while making economic profits"".: 467

Such a business attempts to meet the triple bottom line. They cluster under different groupings, and the whole is sometimes referred to as ""green capitalism."" Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and human rights policies. In general, a business is described as green if it matches the following four criteria:

It incorporates principles of sustainability into each of its business decisions.
It supplies environmentally friendly products or services that replace demand for nongreen products and/or services.
It is greener than traditional competition.
It has made an enduring commitment to environmental principles in its business operations.

Terminology
""Green"" or sustainable businesses (aim to) have a minimal negative impact or potentially a positive effect on the global or local environment, and business practices can be adopted to support these objectives. Thus, a sustainable business participates in environmentally friendly or green activities to ensure that all its processes, products, and manufacturing activities adequately address current environmental concerns while maintaining a profit. In other words, it is a business that ""meets the needs of the present [world] without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."" It assesses how to design products that take advantage of the current environmental situation and how well a company’s products use renewable resources.
The Brundtland Report emphasized that sustainability is a three-legged stool of people, planet, and profit. Sustainable businesses within the supply chain try to balance all three through the triple-bottom-line concept—using sustainable development and sustainable distribution to affect the environment, business growth, and society.

GS4,Wilhelm Ernst Barkhoff,"Wilhelm Ernst Barkhoff (26 June 1916 – 30 September 1994) was a German solicitor, founder of anthroposophically oriented alternative banking, the GLS Bank, reformer of the German welfare system and inspirer of the movement for Ethical banking.

Biography
Born in Kamp-Lintfort, Germany, Wilhelm Ernst Barkhoff was the son of a miner in the German Ruhrgebiet, where he grew up. Already at an early age, through the constant unrest in this area, he developed an interest in social and political questions, but primarily also in philosophical and spiritual ideas and ideals. The concept of transubstantiation became one of his fundamental ideals, though he understood this not in its religious-ecclesiastic sense, but rather tried to realise it in social life, in financial and banking affairs, as also in agriculture and health care.
He studied law in Cologne, Freiburg and Berlin, where, after completing his first state examination, he was conscripted as an officer to do military service in World War II. On the Russian Front he was badly wounded by a grenade, leading to his first out-of-body experience, something that happened on further occasions during his flight on foot from Russia back to Germany.
During the war, he married Ottilie Grave from Bocholt. Their first son was born in 1945, had Down syndrome and lived for only eleven months. Later, the couple had three more sons and a daughter. 
After the war, on completing his articles in 1948, he became a solicitor, founding and running one of the leading law firms in Bochum. He and his wife cultivated close friendships with the artists of the Bochum Art Association.
In 1956, he joined the governing board of the Rudolf Steiner School Ruhrgebiet, which was looking for a legal counsellor. The school was started contrary to the ban on founding further Waldorf schools which the Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen, the German Waldorf School Federation, had attempted to impose at the time. With it began the public life of anthroposophy in t"

This pertains to the design and development of processes and technologies for the sustainable manufacture of bioproducts (materials, chemicals and energy) from renewable biological resources.
Bioproducts engineers harness the molecular building blocks of renewable resources to design, develop and manufacture environmentally friendly industrial and consumer products. From biofuels, renewable energy, and bioplastics to paper products and ""green"" building materials such as bio-based composites, Bioproducts engineers are developing sustainable solutions to meet the world's growing materials and energy demand. Conventional bioproducts and emerging bioproducts are two broad categories used to categorize bioproducts. Examples of conventional bio-based products include building materials, pulp and paper, and forest products. Examples of emerging bioproducts or biobased products include biofuels, bioenergy, starch-based and cellulose-based ethanol, bio-based adhesives, biochemicals, biodegradable plastics, etc. Bioproducts Engineers play a major role in the design and development of ""green"" products including biofuels, bioenergy, biodegradable plastics, biocomposites, building materials, paper and chemicals. Bioproducts engineers also develop energy efficient, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes for these products as well as effective end-use applications. Bioproducts engineers play a critical role in a sustainable 21st century bio-economy by using renewable resources to design, develop, and manufacture the products we use every day. The career outlook for bioproducts engineers is very bright with employment opportunities in a broad range of industries, including pulp and paper, alternative energy, renewable plastics, and other fiber, forest products, building materials and chemical-based industries.

It is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence to support responsible risk decision-making. As of March 2021, 116 financial institutions in 37 countries have officially adopted the Equator Principles, covering the majority of international project finance debt in emerging and developed markets. The Equator Principles, formally launched in Washington, D.C., on June 4, 2003, were based on existing environmental and social policy frameworks established by the International Finance Corporation.
The standards have subsequently been periodically updated into what is commonly known as the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and on the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines. The Equator Principles have recently been revised and the third iteration of the Equator Principles was launched on June 4, 2013. The reviewed fourth iteration of the Equator Principles [1] were published in July 2020.

GS4,Everlane,"Everlane is an American clothing retailer that sells primarily online. Headquartered in San Francisco, California with stores in New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, Austin, and Palo Alto, the company was founded in 2010 by Michael Preysman and Jesse Farmer with the mission of selling clothing  with transparent pricing.

History
Everlane was founded in 2010 by Michael Preysman and Jesse Farmer as a direct-to-consumer online menswear retailer. Preysman and Farmer collaborated with Andy Zhang for the sourcing of ethical materials. The company enables customers to see how much each item costs to produce and how big the company's markup is. Everlane started with a referral invite list that gained 60,000 subscribers in five days, although the company only had 1,500 T-shirts in inventory.
In 2014, Everlane began a partnership with delivery company Postmates to provide same-day delivery to consumers in San Francisco and New York. The company opened brick-and-mortar stores in SoHo in New York City in 2017 and in San Francisco in 2018.

Products and sales
On its website Everlane attempts to educate customers on its supply chain, factories, employees, and the price breakdown of each product.
In 2018, the company pledged to stop using virgin plastic by 2021, including in packaging and in clothing made of synthetic fibers. On October 24, 2018, Everlane launched ReNew, a line of outerwear crafted from materials that were created out of 3 million recycled plastic bottles. The company plans to accomplish their goal by redeveloping the fabrics, yarns, and all raw materials that contain synthetic fibres into recycled components by 2021. In May 2019, Everlane released the DayGlove ReKnit, a shoe made entirely of recycled plastic bottles.

GS4,Sustainable sourcing,"Globalization of supply chains and pressure to lower production costs have negatively impacted environments and communities around the world, especially in developing nations where production of high demand goods is increasingly taking place. Since the 1990s, awareness of these negative impacts has grown, leading stakeholders to push companies to take responsibility and actively work to improve the sustainability of their supply chains. It has come to be understood that a company is only as sustainable as the start of its supply chain, bringing about the need for sustainable sourcing. Sustainable sourcing refers to the inclusion of social, environmental, and economic criteria in the sourcing process.

Background
Sustainable sourcing finds its roots in the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which gained popularity in the United States in the 1970s and internationally in the 1990s. CSR has evolved over time from a philanthropy-based strategy for responding to consumer concerns, to a decision-making process that takes into consideration the various facets of a company's impacts. CSR came to include environmental responsibility in the 1990s with the introduction of John Elkington's ""Triple Bottom Line"", which highlighted the responsibility businesses have to the environment, in addition to their economic and social responsibilities. Since the introduction of the triple bottom line, sustainability has become an important topic for most organizations.
In the past, companies were often able to separate themselves from unsustainable and unethical practices within their supply chains, as long as their internal practices were considered to be sustainable. Supply chain scandals such as child labor in Nike factories in the 1990s, use of toxic lead paint in Mattel toys in the early 2000s, and more recently the collapse of a factory linked to Primark in Bangladesh, however, have worked to increase awareness of unsustainable supply chain behaviors.

GS4,VFS Capital,"VFS Capital Limited formerly known as Village Financial Services Ltd (VFS), is headquartered in Kolkata, was incorporated on 28 June 1994, as a private limited company before it got its present name.
The name Village Financial Services Private Limited (VFSPL) was registered by the Registrar of Companies on 23 January 2006. Subsequently, the Reserve Bank of India granted it a certificate of registration dated 1 December 2006. In 2013, VFSPL became the first microfinance institution (MFI) in eastern India to get the status of an NBFC-MFI or Non-Banking Financial Company-MFI from the RBI.
On 7 November 2017, the company was converted into a public company, after which the RBI granted it a fresh certificate of registration on 4 January 2018. VFS is also the first ISO-certified microfinance company in India. The microfinance operations under VFS have grown phenomenally. It has touched the lives of thousands of poor families by providing them credit for income-generating activities and helping them become economically self-sufficient, besides empowering women (who are the borrowers) and so letting them live with dignity.

History
In 1978, a group of young people got together to help flood victims of West Bengal. In 1982, that developed to Village Welfare Society (VWS) and was registered as a not-for-profit organization. VWS began microfinance activities in 1996 which led to the setting up of Village Micro Credit Services in 2004, a Section 25 not-for-profit company to undertake microfinance activities. The firm was renamed to Village Financial Services Limited, regulated by the RBI. It was reclassified by the RBI as an ‘NBFC-MFI’ on 27 September 2013.
The company was incorporated on 28 June 1994, in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, as a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956, under a different name.

In 2006-07, it acquired a non-banking financial company (NBFC) and became Village Financial Services Pvt Ltd.
In 2013-14, the Reserve Bank of India reclassified VF"
GS4,Principles for Responsible Investment,"Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI or PRI) is a United Nations-supported international network of financial institutions working together to implement its six aspirational principles, often referenced as ""the Principles"". Its goal is to understand the implications of sustainability for investors and support signatories to facilitate incorporating these issues into their investment decision-making and ownership practices. In implementing these principles, signatories contribute to the development of a more sustainable global financial system.
The Principles offer a framework of possible actions for incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance factors into investment practices across asset classes. Responsible investment is a process that must be tailored to fit each organisation's investment strategy, approach and resources. The Principles are designed to be compatible with the investment styles of large, diversified, institutional investors that operate within a traditional fiduciary framework.
As of December 2024, more than 5,000 signatories from over 80 countries representing approximately US$128 trillion have signed up to the Principles. 
In some cases, before retaining an investment manager, institutional investors will inquire as to whether the manager is a signatory.

Overview
About
In early 2005, the then UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, invited a group of the world's largest institutional investors to join a process to develop the Principles for Responsible Investment. A 20-person investor group drawn from institutions in 12 countries was supported by a 70-person group of experts from the investment industry, intergovernmental organisations and civil society. The Principles were launched in April 2006 at the New York Stock Exchange.
The Principles were incubated by the UNEP Finance Initiative and the UN Global Compact and were developed and launched by a joint Secretariat from both organizations including: James Gifford, Paul Cleme"
GS4,Sustainable packaging,"Sustainable packaging is packaging materials and methods that result in improved sustainability. This involves increased use of life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to help guide the use of packaging which reduces the environmental impact and ecological footprint.  It includes a look at the whole of the supply chain: from basic function, to marketing, and then through to end of life (LCA) and rebirth. Additionally, an eco-cost to value ratio can be useful The goals are to improve the long term viability and quality of life for humans and the longevity of natural ecosystems. Sustainable packaging must meet the functional and economic needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is not necessarily an end state but is a continuing process of improvement.
Sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging (see Packaging and labeling). It requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design, choice of materials, processing, and life-cycle. This is not just the vague ""green movement"" that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years.  Companies implementing eco-friendly actions are reducing their carbon footprint, using more recycled materials and reusing more package components.  They often encourage suppliers, contract packagers, and distributors to do likewise.
Environmental marketing claims on packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous greenwashing titles such as green packaging and environmentally friendly can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance to packagers
Companies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable. Using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs. Recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social mov"

GS4,Community development financial institution,"A community development financial institution (US) or community development finance institution (UK) - abbreviated in both cases to CDFI - is a financial institution that provides credit and financial services to underserved markets and populations, primarily in the USA but also in the UK. A CDFI may be a community development bank, a community development credit union (CDCU), a community development loan fund (CDLF), a community development venture capital fund (CDVC), a microenterprise development loan fund, or a community development corporation.
CDFIs are certified by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which provides funds to CDFIs through a variety of programs. The CDFI Fund and the legal concept of CDFIs were established by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. Broadly speaking, a CDFI is defined as a financial institution that: has a primary mission of community development, serves a target market, is a financing entity, provides development services, remains accountable to its community, and is a non-governmental entity.
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) authorized CDFIs certified by the CDFI Fund to become members of the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Final Rule regarding the procedures and standards to be used by the Federal Home Loan Banks to evaluate applications for membership from CDFIs were published in the Federal Register Federal Housing Finance Agency in January 2010. The Final Rule is to be implemented by the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, each of which will evaluate membership applications independently.
CDFIs are related to, but not identical with, Community Development Entities (CDEs). CDEs are also certified by the CDFI Fund at the U.S. Department of Treasury but have somewhat different qualifications. Many CDFIs have also been certified as CDEs.  The primary purpose of CDEs is to utilize the New Markets Tax Credit Program (N"

GS4,Nishkama Karma,"Nishkama Karma (Sanskrit IAST : Niṣkāmakarma), self-less or desireless action, is an action performed without any expectation of fruits or results, and the central tenet of Karma Yoga path to liberation. Its modern advocates press upon achieving success following the principles of Yoga, and stepping beyond personal goals and agendas while pursuing any action over greater good, which has become well known since it is the central message of the Bhagavad Gita.
In Indian philosophy, action or Karma is divided into three categories based on their intrinsic qualities or gunas. Nishkama Karma belongs to the first category, the Sattva (pure) or actions which add to calmness; the Sakama Karma (Self-centred action) comes in the second rājasika (aggression) and Vikarma (worst-action) comes under the third, tāmasika which correlates to darkness or inertia.

Nishkama Karma in the workplace
The opposite of Sakama Karma (action with desire), Nishkama Karma has been variously explained as 'Duty for duty's sake' and as 'Detached Involvement', which is neither negative attitude nor indifference; and has today found many advocates in the modern business area where the emphasis has shifted to ethical business practices adhering to intrinsic human values and reducing stress at the workplace.
Another aspect that differentiates it from Sakama or selfish action, is that while the former is guided by inspiration, the latter is all about motivation, and that makes the central difference in its results, for example, Sakama Karma might lead to excessive work pressure and workaholism as it aims at success, and hence creates more chances of physical and psychological burnouts. Moreover, Nishkama Karma means a more balanced approach to work, and as work has been turned into a pursuit of personal excellence, which results in greater personal satisfaction, which one would have otherwise sought in job satisfaction coming from external rewards. One important fallout of the entire shift is that where "

Calvert is one of the largest responsible investment companies in the United States.

History
In 1976, Calvert's co-founders, Wayne Silby and John Guffey, launched the first variable rate fund in the US before introducing the Calvert Social Investment Fund (CSIF) in 1982. The Calvert Social Investment Fund (CSIF) was the first mutual fund to oppose Apartheid, and then one of the first groups to reinvest in free South Africa in 1994.
In 1986, Calvert became one of the first mutual fund groups to sponsor a shareholder resolution. Calvert filed with the Angelica Corporation, identifying potential financial impact of labor management issue. 
Calvert Investments founded the Calvert Foundation, a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit, in 1988. The goal of the foundation is to invest directly in underserved communities.
In 1992, Calvert launched World Values Fund, the first International SRI mutual fund. Calvert also started a Special Equities Program for high impact social ventures. At the time, this program was one of the first of its kind in the responsible investing field.
In 1998, Calvert pursued an advisory opinion from the U.S. Department of Labor in support of the inclusion of sustainable and responsible investment options in defined contribution plans. In a letter to Calvert, the Department of Labor stated that it believes sustainable and responsible investment options are not inconsistent with fiduciary standards.
In 2000, Calvert introduced The Calvert Social Index (renamed Calvert US Large Cap Core Responsible Index in June 2015), which is an unmanaged index that measures the performance of large, U.S.-based sustainable and responsible companies.
Calvert began expanding the number of investment strategies offered that addressed global sustainability challenges through "
GS4,Vollpension,"Vollpension (pronounced [ˈfɔlpaŋˌzi̯oːn] ) is a coffee house in Vienna, Austria. It is best known for employing the elderly as bakers and servers, thus supplementing the low income of retirees and providing opportunities for socialization. It is considered a particularly successful example of a social business.

History
Vollpension was set up as a pop-up café in 2012 by a group of young people who wished to serve cakes such as those made by grandmothers. It was meant to be a temporary project at the Vienna Design Week, but the Austrian Tourist Association became aware of it and sent the baking seniors across the country for three months. Ten ""grandmothers"" thus toured Austria to serve at festivals, beer parties, and fairs. In 2015 a permanent location was chosen, at Schleifmühlgasse 16, near Vienna's historic outdoor market Naschmarkt, to ensure that the business would become stable.
According to Hannah Lux, one of the owners, Vollpension served over 80,000 cakes in 2018 and had a revenue of 1.2 million euros. In September 2019 Vollpension opened another branch at Johannesgasse 4a. Due to this extension, and the purposeful employment primarily of older people, Vollpension was hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic when it reached Austria in March 2020. That year Vollpension launched the ""world's first Grandma Baking School"", an online platform called BakAdemy (German: BackAdemie), which offers on-demand live baking courses from elders across the world, including India, New Zealand, the United States and Australia.

Brand and aesthetic
The name Vollpension, meaning ""full pension"", refers to both the retirement pension and to a hotel stay that includes meals, or full board.
Vollpension's aesthetic features worn furniture, small vases, doilies, and animal figurines and is meant to give the visitor a feeling of a warm family room. The café is frequented by multigenerational groups and often young mothers with children.
The main focus of Vollpension are cakes, wh"
GS4,AroundYou,"AroundYou is an Australian social enterprise founded in 2009 and focused on using digital technology to promote community engagement and participation.

GS4,Paperless office,"A paperless office (or paper-free office) is a work environment in which the use of paper is eliminated or greatly reduced. This is done by converting documents and other papers into digital form, a process known as digitization. Proponents claim that ""going paperless"" can save money, boost productivity, save space, make documentation and information sharing easier, keep personal information more secure, and help the environment. The concept can be extended to communications outside the office as well.

Definition and history
The paperless world was a publicist's slogan, intended to describe the office of the future. It was facilitated by the popularization of video display computer terminals like the 1964 IBM 2260. An early prediction of the paperless office was made in a 1975 Business Week article. The idea was that office automation would make paper redundant for routine tasks such as record-keeping and bookkeeping, and it came to prominence with the introduction of the personal computer. While the prediction of a PC on every desk was remarkably prophetic, the ""paperless office"" was not. 
In 1983, Micronet, Inc. attempted to trademark the phrase ""The Paperless Office"", but abandoned this application in 1984.
In 2019, an analyst in New Zealand suggested that a more appropriate goal for an office may be to become ""paper-light"" rather than ""paperless"".
In 2022, the CEO of Foxit marketed its firm's vision of the ""paperless office"" as having economic as well as sustainability advantages.
According to one estimate, the worldwide use of office paper more than doubled from 1980 to 2000. This was attributed to the increased ease of document production and widespread use of electronic communication, which resulted in users receiving large numbers of printed documents.
In 2014, an analyst in the USA asserted that ""we are actually accelerating in our use of paper with the annual growth rate of the amount of paper produced by the average company standing at 25%. Each day, an "
GS4,Central Surrey Health,"Central Surrey Health, also known as CSH Surrey, was the first employee-owned community healthcare social enterprise to be “spun out” of the NHS, in 2006.  It is one of the 11 health and social care providers who are known as the Surrey Heartlands Health and Care Partnership.
It runs four community hospitals, in Leatherhead, Molesey, New Epsom and Ewell, and Dorking.
It was set up as a not-for-profit, limited liability company under contract to provide community nursing and therapy services on behalf of the East Elmbridge and Mid Surrey Primary Care Trust. About 650 former PCT nursing and therapy staff transferred to the new organisation.  The Financial Times said it would operate ""a little like a John Lewis-style partnership, with staff owning the company, which can make profits but will also risk going bust."" It had a three-year contract worth about £20m a year. The intention at the time was to encourage more of the same with a unit in the Department of Health that would have a budget to help create business plans for other staff to follow suit.  Health service unions Amicus and UNISON saw this as further evidence of the government's desire to break up the NHS.
However, in 2011 NHS Surrey failed to renew the contract and awarded the five year £500m local community services contract to Assura Medical. It appeared that because it did not have £10 million in the bank as surety for the contract CSH lost out.
It is involved in a community-based diabetes service for Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group with Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust  South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, and local GPs to start in November 2014.
In September 2014 the organisation, now trading as CSH, in partnership with Bupa won a five-year contract from Coastal West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group for £235m to provide musculoskeletal services.

GS4,Closing the Loop,"Closing the Loop is a company that offers a closed loop service for mobile phones. The Dutch social enterprise is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was founded with the aim to reduce electronic waste (e-waste). It does this by offering users and sellers of phones a way to make their device material-neutral and waste free. The company pays people in emerging markets to collect scrap phones. These phones are then recycled for Closing the Loop’s customers. The proposition works on a one for one basis, where a customer’s phone is ‘offset’ by the recycling of a broken phone. Known customers are Shiftphone, T-Mobile, KPMG, the city of Utrecht, Rabobank and the Dutch national government.
Closing the Loop buys and collects 'end-of-life' scrap phones in African countries, which are known to be places where many used phones from Europe and the US get a second life. The waste Closing the Loop collects, is recycled in Europe. In this way Closing the Loop turns scrap phones into valuable resources and an income for people in developing countries. Its goal is to prevent mobile phones from ending up in dump sites and at the same time create a more sustainable telecom industry.

Impact
Closing the Loop has saved more than 2.2 million mobile phones from the dump in Africa and gave more than 145,000 mobile phones a second life. Mobile phones are bought from informal local collector networks. To date, Closing the Loop has helped more than 2,000 people in Africa to earn additional income through safe employment.
The social enterprise sees e-waste as an opportunity. An opportunity to source companies with responsibly sourced metals, to make industries like telecom circular - by closing loops - and to create income for people in emerging markets. It aims to contribute to the circular economy and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Domini's great-grandfather Joseph Lee was the author of Constructive and Preventive Philanthropy (Macmillan, 1902). Domini grew up in Newtown, Connecticut, and received a BA from Boston University in 1973.

Career
After college, Domini began work as a copy-clerk for brokerage firm Tucker Anthony, and rose through the ranks quickly to become a retail broker.  Domini began working in socially responsible investing in 1980. Domini is the founder and chief executive officer of Domini Impact Investments and one of the founders of KLD Research & Analytics, a research firm. In 1990 with partners Peter Kinder and Steve Lyndenberg, she created the Domini 400 Social Index, a stock market index selected according to social and environmental standards. In 1991 she founded the Domini Social Impact Equity Fund, an index fund based on the Domini 400 Social Index. The fund held $1.3 billion in assets as of 2001 and over its first ten years rose 15.08 percent compared with 15.25 percent growth for the S&P 500 in the same period. Only 25 percent of all funds performed on par with the S&P in that period and the success of Domini's fund helped establish socially responsible investing as compatible with strong financial returns, where previously the field was seen as low-performing in this respect.
In 2005, Time named Domini to its list of the world's most influential people.

GS4,Minority business enterprise,"Minority business enterprise (MBE) is an American designation for businesses which are at least 51% owned, operated and controlled on a daily basis by one or more (in combination) American citizens of the following ethnic minority and/or gender (e.g. woman-owned) and/or military veteran classifications:

African American
Asian American or Pacific Islander (includes West Asian Americans (Iran, etc.) and East Asian Americans (Japan, Korea, etc.))
Hispanic American - A U.S. citizen of true-born Hispanic heritage, from any of the Spanish-speaking areas of the following regions: Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean Basin only.  Brazilians (Afro-Brazilian, indigenous/Indian only) shall be listed under Hispanic designation for review and certification purposes.
Native American, including Aleuts
According to the Minority Business Development Agency, minorities own more than 8 million firms, and account for nearly $1.4 trillion in revenues.
MBEs can self-identify, but are typically certified by a city, state or federal agency.  Over $300 million were paid to many who self-identify as Cherokee.

Public contract bidding
Certain states within the United States, as a part of their bidding process, incentivize MBEs and women-owned business enterprises to bid on publicly awarded construction or service contracts. They may also declare that a percentage of the work performed on a contract be awarded to a MBE or women-owned business enterprise.

In New York, the goal for the award of public contracts is to increase from 20% in 2014 to 30% by 2019. In 2018, the state was also considering establishing goals for the workforce of contractors awarded public contracts, but insisted these goals were not quotas. If contractors could not make a ""good faith"" effort to reach the goals, contractors might not be eligible for future public contracts for a length determined by the state.

GS4,ISO 14051,"ISO 14051 is part of the ISO 14000 family of standards relating to environmental management codified by the International Organization for Standardization. The purpose of ISO 14051:2011 is to provide principles and generic guidelines on material flow cost accounting. The norm seeks to provide a universally recognized paradigm for practitioners and companies employing material flow cost accounting. It is not intended for third parties certification.

Introduction
ISO 14051 was published as a standard in 2011.  It covers the implementation of material flow cost accounting (MFCA). In MFCA energy can be accounted as part of the cost of flow of materials or separated. Many organizations are unaware of the real cost of loss of materials due to incomplete recording in traditional cost accounting. This norm aims to fulfill a gap providing a tool to use an integrate accounting perspective that helps to reduce environmental impact and financial costs.

Scope
ISO 14051:2011 provides general framework for the implementation of material flow cost accounting in small, medium and big organizations. In MFCA flow and inventories of materials are measured in physical amounts (i.e. mass, volume, liters, etc.) and the costs related with these flows are also taken into account and assessed.
ISO 14051 is a tool of environmental management accounting and it provides information for internal use.
MFCA can be extended to other organizations in the supply chain, both upstream and downstream, thus helping to develop an integrated approach to improving material and energy efficiency in the supply chain. This extension can be beneficial because waste generation in an organization is often driven by the nature or quality of materials provided by a supplier, or the specification of the product requested by a customer.

Cost estimation under ISO 14051:2011
MFCA are estimated three kind of costs:
(1) Material cost
(2) System cost
(3) Waste management cost.

GS4,Refugee employment,"Refugee employment refers to the employment of refugees. Gaining access to legal paid work can be a requirement for asylum status or citizenship in a host country and may be done with or without the assistance of non-governmental organizations. In some specific cases, refugees may also be given work by NGO's while en route to their intended destination (so working a country in between the intended destination country and the origin country). The latter may occur, if the intended destination country have closed their borders to migrants, and if staying in the origin country isn't an option either (i.e. due to lack of economic opportunities, climate change impact or insecurity in the origin country).

Refugee workforce integration
Refugees are often faced with under-employment, unemployment and employment in informal economy. In this sense, many researchers and practitioners call for not just simple refugee employment, but a successful refugee workforce integration. Refugee workforce integration is understood to be a process in which refugees engage in economic activities (employment or self-employment), which are commensurate with individuals' professional goals and previous qualifications and experience, and provide adequate economic security and prospects for career advancement.
These barriers are sometimes called the canvass ceiling, by analogy to the glass ceiling for women.

Refugee international adjustment
International adjustment is a process of achieving a “fit between [individuals] and the new environment in both work and non-work domains.”

Refugee employment agreements
145 countries have signed the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In countries that have signed the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, refugees are entitled to gainful employment under Chapter 3. Three articles in Chapter 3 pertain to the employment of refugees.

Its origin as a phenomenon of the post-Soviet history of the country should be attributed to the first half of the 2000s,  although similar initiatives of individual enthusiasts occasionally took place already in the 1990s, and prototypes of social and entrepreneurial activity can be found also in earlier periods, up to the turn of the XIX-XX centuries.
The systematic development of this area of business activity has started in the second half of the 2000s in Russia and it was associated, first of all, with the emergence of a number of strong systemic private players developing infrastructure, stimulating social entrepreneurs, developing and promoting the theoretical base. Through their efforts, ideas of social entrepreneurship are conveyed to the legislative and executive authorities, the business communities, society in general and potential social entrepreneurs, which gradually creates, formalizes and structures this area. Since the early 2010s, Social Innovation Centers (SICs) have emerged in Russia, which provide training in social entrepreneurship methods and support existing projects.
As of the end of 2020, the popularity of social entrepreneurship in Russia remains low: no more than 1% of Russian entrepreneurs are engaged in social business. Their contribution to the country's GDP in 2015 was 0.36%. More than half of Russian social entrepreneurs are women aged 30–60.
A number of sustainable projects are operating in Russia, mainly in the areas of farming, recycling of certain types of household waste, supporting for the disabled and elderly persons and graduates of orphanages as well, the revival of folk crafts, local tourism, but they also cannot boast of an unconditional success, scale of activity, and even more the replicability of their experience. Large problem areas of paramount importance, such as drug addiction, alcoholism, unemployment, general low living standards, corruption and bureaucracy, are"
GS4,Men's shed,"Men's sheds or community sheds are non-profit local organisations that provide a space for craftwork and social interaction. The movement originated in Australia around the 1980s as a way to improve the health and wellbeing of older men. However some have expanded their remit to anyone regardless of age or gender, and have similar aims and functions to hackerspaces. There are over 900 located across Australia, with thousands of active members. Men's sheds can also be found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States, Canada, Finland, Estonia, New Zealand and Greece.
The slogan for men's sheds is ""Shoulder To Shoulder"", shortened from ""Men don't talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder"", adopted after the 2008 Australian Men's Shed Association (AMSA) conference. The users of men's sheds are known as ""shedders"". In 2014, Professor Barry Golding coined the term ""shedagogy"" to describe ""a distinctive, new way of acknowledging, describing and addressing the way some men prefer to learn informally in shed-like spaces mainly with other men."" Sheds as a venue for mentoring other men and Inter-generational mentoring is a growing outcome. Academics are using men's sheds as a research venue and research partner in exploring men's health and social needs.

History
The men's shed movement originated in Australia. One of the precursors of the movement began in the 1980s in Broken Hill, New South Wales, involving former miners. Another was the Albury Manual Activities Centre, also known as ""Albury Men's Shed"" which opened in 1978. Work in Adelaide, South Australia focused upon the gender biased and inappropriate care of older men living with dementia in care settings and work with Vietnam Veterans in South Australia also played its part. 
Professor Barry Golding has researched the origins of the men's shed, and states ""Maxine Chaseling was the key person behind 'The Shed' back in the early nineties and spoke of the stories behind the development of the Shed."" The first "
GS4,Benetech,"Benetech is a nonprofit social enterprise organization that empowers communities with software for social good. Previous projects include the Route 66 Literacy Project, the Miradi environmental project management software, Martus (human rights abuse reporting), and the Human Rights Data Analysis Group. Current program areas include global education, human rights, and poverty alleviation.

About
One of Benetech's key education program initiatives is Bookshare, an e-book library for people with print disabilities such as dyslexia, blindness, low vision, and physical disabilities.
Another project is Benetech Service Net, an open standards data exchange platform that makes it easier to share and maintain information on local social and human services. Organizations providing referrals or referral technology (such as 2-1-1s, Healthify, or Health Leads) and agencies providing information about their services (such as community-based shelters, food pantries, or government agencies) can work together to make better data available for everyone.

History
Benetech was founded by technology entrepreneur Jim Fruchterman in Palo Alto, California, under the name of Arkenstone in 1989. It was initially created to provide reading machines for blind people. During the period 1989–2000, over 35,000 reading machines were sold in sixty countries, reading twelve different languages. In 2000, the Arkenstone reading machine product line was sold to Freedom Scientific, and the nonprofit's name was changed to Benetech. The funding from the asset sale was used to start the Bookshare initiative and Martus project in 2001.
Benetech and its Martus software were featured on the PBS NewsHour.
In 2019, Benetech announced the expansion of its inclusive education initiatives, creating new partnerships with organisations such as Vision Australia, the Royal National Institute of Blind People in the UK, National Council for the Blind of Ireland, Canada's Center for Equitable Library Access and the Dubai"
GS4,Social venture capital,"Social venture capital is a form of investment funding that is usually funded by a group of social venture capitalists or an impact investor to provide seed-funding investment, usually in a for-profit social enterprise, in return to achieve an outsized gain in financial return while delivering social impact to the world. There are various organizations, such as Venture Philanthropy (VP) companies and nonprofit organizations, that deploy a simple venture capital strategy model to fund nonprofit events, social enterprises, or activities that deliver a high social impact or a strong social causes for their existence. There are also regionally focused organizations (both for-profit and nonprofit) that target a specific region of the world, to help build and support the local community in a social cause.

Investment criteria
Apart from the traditional venture capitalists focusing on just the financial profit, social venture capitalists believe in achieving financial success through social impact to the world. Beside, those Venture Philanthropy (VP) funds such as Venture Philanthropy Partners initiate investment in a high-performing nonprofit organization, the following criteria that social venture capitalists generally assess on social venture companies for funding:

Strong Social Impact

GS4,SDG Publishers Compact,"The United Nations SDG Publishers Compact is a non-binding United Nations pact open to publishers, associations, booksellers and other organizations involved in the publishing industry, in support of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Research and education is important to making progress toward achieving the 17 development goals.
The SDG Publishers Compact contains 10 commitments for signatories  to take in support of reaching the 17 development goals by 2030. Signatories are encouraged both to  develop sustainable practices within their own industry and to ""inform, develop, and inspire action” on the SDGs worldwide through the publication of relevant books, journals and other materials. 
As of February 19, 2023, 285 organizations worldwide were signatories of the SDG Publishers Compact, including 15 international and national publishers associations. An action group and signatory of the Compact, known as the SDG Publishers Compact Fellows, translates the ten commitments into actionable steps. The SDG Compact Fellows develop detailed action lists and tip sheets for use by signatories and other supporters. 
Member organizations are taking a wide variety of actions in support of the SDGs.

Formation
Development of the SDG Publishers Compact followed the creation of the Sustainable Development Goals Book Club, organized in 2018 and launched at the 2019 Bologna Children's Book Fair. The International Publishers Association (IPA) and others partnered to release a reading list of books appropriate for children ages  6- to 12,  with a monthly focus on Sustainable Development Goals. The first month's reading list focused on  SDG 1: No Poverty, and included both newer works such as A Chair for My Mother by Vera B.

GS4,Achieving for Children,"Achieving for Children (AfC) is a social enterprise company created in 2014 by the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames to provide social services for children. It is thought to have been the first company of its kind.
Ofsted rates Achieving for Children as ""outstanding"" for children's services in the Kingston borough, following an inspection in October 2019.
When the company was launched in 2014, it was described as the ""future model of Children's Services"". It enabled the two councils to save money by sharing services whilst avoiding some of the ""organisational difficulties"", and allowing them to work in ways that would not be possible as a local authority.  Some critics were concerned that AfC represented a privatisation of children' social services as well as a reduction in accountability and scrutiny, and there was scepticism over whether service levels could be maintained and improved in the wake of significant spending cuts. The organisation was subsequently credited with improving Kingston's children's services from an ""Inadequate"" to ""good"" Ofsted rating.  A 2016 independent Government review of the establishment of AfC concluded that the transformation had demonstrated positive results for service quality and financial return, with a number of benefits realised as well as lessons learned.
On 1 August 2017, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead became a co-owner of AfC, which now delivers children's services across all three boroughs.
In December 2019, Kingston and Richmond Councils both agreed to recommission Achieving for Children to deliver their children's services until 31 March 2026.

Similar organisations to AfC have been created in Doncaster and Slough, though these were established as part of Government interventions rather than voluntarily.

GS4,Social entrepreneurship,"Social entrepreneurship is an approach by individuals, groups, start-up companies or entrepreneurs, in which they develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues. This concept may be applied to a wide range of organizations, which vary in size, aims, and beliefs. For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like profit, revenues and increases in stock prices. Social entrepreneurs, however, are either non-profits, or they blend for-profit goals with generating a positive ""return to society"". Therefore, they use different metrics. Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social, cultural and environmental goals often associated with the voluntary sector in areas such as poverty alleviation, health care and community development.
At times, profit-making social enterprises may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in themselves. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the homeless may operate a restaurant, both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless.
In 2010, social entrepreneurship was facilitated by the use of the Internet, particularly social networking and social media websites. These websites enable social entrepreneurs to reach numerous people who are not geographically close yet who share the same goals and encourage them to collaborate online, learn about the issues, disseminate information about the group's events and activities, and raise funds through crowdfunding.
In recent years, researchers have been calling for a better understanding of the ecosystem in which social entrepreneurship exists and social ventures operate. This will help them formulate better strategy and help achieve their double bottom line objective.

Modern definition
The concept and terminology of social entrepreneurship emerged in the 1950s and since then has been gaining more momentum. Despite"
GS4,Sustainable capitalism,"Sustainable capitalism is a conceptual form of capitalism based on sustainable practices that seek to preserve humanity and the planet, while reducing externalities and bearing a resemblance of capitalist economic policy. A capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion. Capitalist systems are often destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation. However, sustainability provides quite the opposite; it implies not only a continuation, but a replenishing of resources. Sustainability is often thought of to be related to environmentalism, and sustainable capitalism applies sustainable principles to economic governance and social aspects of capitalism as well.
The importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized, but the concept is not new. Changes to the current economic model would have heavy social environmental and economic implications and require the efforts of individuals, as well as compliance of local, state and federal governments. Controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors.
This is a concept of capitalism described in Al Gore and David Blood’s manifesto for generation investment management to describe a long-term political, economic and social structure which would mitigate current threats to the planet and society. According to their manifesto, sustainable capitalism would integrate the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects into risk assessment in attempt to limit externalities. Most of the ideas they list are related to economic changes, and social aspects, but strikingly few are explicitly related to any environmental policy change.

Governance and economic aspects
Economic aspects are clearest, perhaps because the economy is most easily associated with capitalism. Sustainable capitalism, as a policy outline, is an attempt to add"
GS4,Sustainable fashion,"Sustainable fashion is a term describing efforts within the fashion industry to reduce its environmental impacts, protect workers producing garments and uphold animal welfare. Sustainability in fashion encompasses a wide range of factors, including cutting CO2 emissions, addressing overproduction, reducing pollution and waste, supporting biodiversity and ensuring that garment workers are paid a fair wage and have safe working conditions.
In 2020, it was found that voluntary, self-directed reform of textile manufacturing supply chains by large companies to reduce the environmental impacts was largely unsuccessful. Measures to reform fashion production beyond greenwashing require policies for the creation and enforcement of standardized certificates, along with related import controls, subsidies, and interventions such as eco-tariffs.

Background and history
In the early 1990s, roughly coinciding with the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, popularly known as the Rio Earth Summit, 'green issues' (as they were called at the time) made their way into fashion and textile publications. These publications featured companies such as Patagonia and ESPRIT. Doug Tompkins and Yvon Chouinard noted that exponential growth and consumption are not sustainable. In the late 1980s, they commissioned research into the impact of fibers used in their respective companies. Fiber and fabric processing are still the norm in sustainable fashion 30 years on.
In 1992, the ESPRIT e-collection was developed by head designer Lynda Grose and launched at retail. In parallel with industry, research around sustainable fashion has been in development since the early 1990s. The field includes technical projects that try to improve the efficiency of existing operations.
In the European Union, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations required in 2007 that clothing manufacturers and importers identify and quantify the chemicals"

It was started in 2008, and calls itself a ""social enterprise"". By 2022, Bridge had around 750,000 students in its schools. As of March 2023, it is the world's largest for-profit primary education chain. Its parent company is NewGlobe Schools, Inc.

History
Shannon May, her husband Jay Kimmelman, and Phil Frei, a former roommate of Kimmelman's co-founded Bridge International Academies and opened the first school in Nairobi, Kenya in 2008. By 2022, Bridge had around 750,000 students in its schools. As of March 2023, Bridge has schools in Uganda, Nigeria, Liberia, and India in addition to Kenya, and is the world's largest for-profit primary education chain.
Bridge opened a London, UK office.
In 2016, Bridge opened six schools in Andhra Pradesh, India in a partnership with the Government of Andhra Pradesh to use disused school buildings to create Bridge schools.
Bridge won the 2016 Global Shared Value award in Kenya.
In 2016, Bridge expanded to Liberia as part of the Liberian Education Advancement Program (LEAP) that selected eight private companies to take over 93 public schools. Bridge started with running 23 schools, and as of February 2023, it runs about 360 of 487 LEAP schools.
Costs for bridge schools net losses and revenues are estimated and are not released by the firm, with losses in 2016 estimated $12m a year and with a total revenue of $16m / year.
In 2017, the number of Bridge academies in Lagos, Nigeria increased. Bridge removed pupils after taking control of schools with large class sizes, and removed 74% of incumbent teachers from their schools.

GS4,Food from the 'Hood,"Food from the 'Hood was a high school-based, student-owned, organically farmed products company that also marketed a line of natural salad dressings.  Founded in 1993, the non-profit organization was still in business in 2003, during the 10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots from which it was born.

Early history
The program was founded in 1993 in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In the wake of the riots, Crenshaw High School biology teacher Tammy Bird, met a non-profit organization, Gardens For Kids, which offered to help her restore the garden in the back of her classroom.  Melinda McMullen, a public relations executive, joined Bird shortly thereafter.  Together, they offered students at Crenshaw High School the opportunity to help rebuild their community by reclaiming a 1/4-acre weed-infested plot of land behind Bird's classroom.
Initially, the students decided to grow organic foods and donate 25% of their bounty to a local non-profit organization called ""Helpers for the Homeless and the Hungry"".  They decided they would sell the rest at the Santa Monica Farmer's Market under the name ""Food from the 'Hood"".  At the end of the first year, they had a total of $600, which funded small college scholarships for the three graduating students. With more students scheduled to graduate the following year, it was clear that the students needed another plan. 2,000 dollars in scholarships in the recent years

Press coverage and growth
In October 1993, Ron Harris, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, publicized their story in a widely-read column. Norris Bernstein, former president of Bernstein's Salad Dressing, heard about the students' efforts and contacted Food from the 'Hood.  Now retired, Bernstein volunteered to help with the final work on the salad dressing formula, help price the product, and develop a marketing plan.
Bernstein became part of the adult team of advisers. Bird supervised the students' work garden and helped manage the weekly trips to t"
GS4,Kanthari international,"kanthari is an educational and training institute at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. It was co-founded by Sabriye Tenberken and Paul Kronenberg in 2005, with the first members jointing in 2009, as an extension of their pioneering project Braille without borders. The not-for-profit institute aims to identify and train persons who have had to face adverse social conditions including physical disabilities, poverty, war strife. Its original official name was ""International Institute for Social Entrepreneurship"". However, to avoid the common notion of monetary gains using the word 'entrepreneurship', the founders renamed the project as kanthari. The initial lower case letters used in the name are intentionally kept as a symbol of their ideology.

kanthari, the word
'kanthari' (Malayalam: കാന്താരി) is the name of a pepper chilly that is indigenous to the land of Kerala state, India. Kanthari is known for its extreme hotness despite its small size. But it also has numerous medical values like lowering the blood pressure etc.. According to Sabriye, the head of the institute, the spice is very representative of the 'small' people who in fact, with the right motivation and preparation, can bring in a drastic and innovative change within the society. 
As a symbol of the institute's deterrence to prejudices and normally accepted conventions, kanthari international is spelt and written with all letters in lowercase.

GS4,Bluewashing,"Bluewashing (a word with similar connotations to ""whitewash"" and ""greenwash"") is a term used to describe deceptive marketing that overstates a company's commitment to responsible social practices. It can be used interchangeably with the term greenwashing but has a greater focus on economic and community factors. Alternatively, it could be phrased in a way that companies hide the social damage that their policies have caused.
Active disinformation is a tool that companies use to make their goods or services more attractive to their consumers and shareholders.

Terminology
Bluewashing is a relatively new term that is still being established. It has generally been accepted to be a spin on greenwashing with a greater focus on social and economic responsibility, but the actual definition varies in different academia.
Bluewashing was first used in relation to the United Nations and their July 2000 Global Compact. A report found that 40% of corporate members who volunteered for the compact did not use its ten principles to make any policy reforms. The compact is non-binding, and the United Nations has publicly stated that it does not have the resources to monitor the bodies who are supposedly participating in it. Therefore, concerns were raised that participating companies were using the compact as a way to ""blue wash"" their reputation aka improve public perception of their morals without legitimately introducing any policy reforms. The companies who joined were accused of using the United Nations' ""excellent social reputation"" to improve their own standing. The word blue was inspired by the colour of the United Nations' flag.
Other interpretations have been made in the digital domain. Van Dijk and co-authors use the term in the context of human rights such as privacy. Bluewashing here refers to the minimal instrumental use by organizations of supposed right-protecting measures like privacy by design without adequate checks, in order to portray themselves as more privacy-f"
GS4,Social Reporting Standard,"The Social Reporting Standard (SRS) provides a standardized reporting guideline for initiatives and projects in the non-profit sector. The term SRS is inspired by the Financial Reporting Standards of for-profit companies.
Unlike traditional businesses, social enterprises and non-profit organisations are not primarily focused on maximizing profits, but rather on social issues. Therefore, the application of Financial Reporting Standards for such organisations is not appropriate. Thus, the development of the SRS, which takes into account the unique goals of non-for-profit organisations, is essential.
Generally speaking, all reporting guidelines in the social sector can be regarded as SRS. Such a concept for reporting standards (accounting and legal) in the social sector has been developed by several experts in the German social sector. Thus far the SRS has received broad support and is widely used. The Social Reporting Standard (SRS) approach is an open non-commercial project.

Background
Similar to the reporting and annual financial statements of for-profit organisations, social entrepreneurs, non-profit organisations, and other organisations with social objectives also regularly report on their activities. For example, they commonly report to the public, their donors, investors and sponsors, authorities, or to their partners.
While for-profit organisations are required to report in accordance with laws of generally accepted principles such as the German ""Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB)” (comparable with the US GAAP or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)), consistent reporting standards for socially oriented organisations, however, have not yet been established. Consistent reporting enables social businesses’ stakeholders to compare information. Comparability is a very important element in addressing potential investors and also relevant for other stakeholders. Complex norms for sustainability reporting standards such as that of the Global Reporting Initiat"
GS4,SIRUM (organization),"SIRUM (Supporting Initiatives to Redistribute Unused Medicine) is a non-profit social enterprise started by three Stanford University students to decrease the amount of medicine going to waste in the U.S. by redistributing unused, unexpired drugs to safety-net clinics and other organizations. They are the largest redistributor of surplus medicine in the United States.

Background
An estimated $5 billion worth of usable medicine goes to waste each year in the United States—yet 1 in 4 adults report difficulty affording prescription drugs. Medication non-adherence in America results in an estimated 131,000 annual deaths, costing up to $528 billion annually. Wasting $11 billion of usable medicine each year has consequences for Americans: it contributes to polluted air and water supplies, and leads to the duplicative purchasing and manufacturing of drugs to meet patient needs—which could otherwise be met by drawing on medication surplus.
Much of the surplus unused medicine wasted each year resides with healthcare organizations, long-term care facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers. Because these surplus medications remain in institutional settings throughout their life cycles, their integrity is carefully maintained by trained healthcare professionals. Patients who cannot afford to purchase the prescriptions they need could greatly benefit from having access to these safe, unexpired, and unopened medications that otherwise go to waste.

Operations
SIRUM leverages technology to connect surplus unused medicine to patients in need. SIRUM provides “recycling” boxes to medicine donors such as long-term care facilities and licensed pharmacies, who package unopened, unexpired medication and ship them directly to community partners  such as safety-net providers, nonprofit pharmacies, and drug repository programs. The organizations’ healthcare providers or pharmacists then distribute the donated medication to patients. SIRUM provides an online platform to handle"
GS4,LifeSpring Hospitals,"LifeSpring Hospitals is an Indian hospital chain, which provides maternity care to women from the low-income group in Hyderabad, India. Established in 2005, it is a 50-50 joint venture between $30-million Acumen Fund, a U.S.-based nonprofit global venture philanthropy fund and HLL Lifecare Limited, a Government of India -owned corporation and the largest manufacturer of condoms in the world.
As of September 2017 it provided affordable healthcare to 5,500,000 women with its ten hospitals in Hyderabad, and one hospital in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India, providing maternity and pediatric care at 30-50 percent of market rates, and is the first healthcare chain to join the 'Business Call to Action' (BCA), an initiative of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Global Compact amongst others, to reduce poverty, hunger, disease, and maternal and child deaths by 2015.

History
The first LifeSpring hospital was started on 10 December 2005 in Moula-Ali, on the outskirts on Hyderabad, India, as a pilot project within Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion Trust (HLFPPT) of Hindustan Latex Limited, now HLL Lifecare Limited (HLL) for low-cost healthcare. In February 2008, it was formed as into a private limited company with 50-50 joint venture between Acumen Fund, a U. S.-based nonprofit global venture philanthropy fund and HLL. The project was headed by Anant Kumar, who was till then the business head of Social Franchising in HLFPPT, who later became Life-Spring's CEO. HLL is a public-sector undertaking under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, while New York-based Acumen, was established in 2001, with seed capital from the Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco Systems Foundation and three individual philanthropists.

GS4,Triple bottom line,"The triple bottom line (or otherwise noted as TBL or 3BL) is an accounting framework with three parts: social, environmental (or ecological) and economic. Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value. Business writer John Elkington claims to have coined the phrase in 1994.

Background
In traditional business accounting and common usage, the ""bottom line"" refers to either the ""profit"" or ""loss"", which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and social justice advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing full cost accounting. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how can we capture a fuller societal cost benefit analysis? The triple bottom line adds two more ""bottom lines"": social and environmental (ecological) concerns. With the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to natural capital and human capital measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting ecological footprint. Use of the TBL is fairly widespread in South African media, as found in a 1990–2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.

GS4,Humanistic capitalism,"Humanistic capitalism is a concept that seeks to unite humanism, specifically the safety and health needs of people and the environment, with market forces and a market-based economy. It is often seen as a middle ground between the ideas of modern capitalism and democratic socialism.
Muhammad Yunus describes humanistic capitalism as a socially conscious business world where investors are content to recoup their investments but do not expect additional dividends.
The idea of humanistic capitalism is linked with the idea that fundamental changes must take place in economics today, as humanistic capitalism requires that there be a blending of the non-profit and for-profit sectors. If investors can accept the decrease in financial returns for those on a social level, humanistic capitalism will become a successful force in driving economic and social change. Philanthropy is a fundamental concept to humanistic capitalism. While the idea of humanistic capitalism is still growing, over ""72% percent of social entrepreneurs say that raising money is a problem,"" and fundraising is a major issue to social entrepreneurs, who rely on philanthropy for support and funding.

Businesses today
There are also many businesses today that already combine the needs of the environment with the needs of people and the environment. SustainAbility, a company established in 1987, defines their purpose as to ""seek solutions to social and environmental challenges that deliver long term value,"" and has worked on projects to ""identify opportunities to innovate products and services with a reduced environmental footprint.""
JEP Foundation promotes the philosophies of humanistic capitalism to create a kinder, gentler economic approach. The principles of Just Enough Profit (JEP) are used by companies to define what they stand for, how they treat their customers and employees, and how they serve humanity.

GS4,Bank Australia,"Bank Australia is an Australian customer-owned bank based in Collingwood, Victoria. The organisation can trace its origins back to 1957, when the CSIRO Co-operative Credit Society was formed. Over succeeding years, mergers among 72 other credit unions and co-operative banks eventually led to the creation of the Members & Education Credit Union (mecu) in 2003, which became Bankmecu in 2011, and Bank Australia in 2015.
Bank Australia is a member organisation of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values and is a certified B Corporation. As of 2023 it had 186,863 customer-members.

History
The bank has its origins in the 19 September 1957 incorporation of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) Co-operative Credit Society. Walter Ives was appointed as chairman, and the first 40 members, limited to officers and employees of CSIRO aged over 18, were admitted on 15 October. 
At the end of 1966 the credit union had over 1770 members, and in that year Joel Belkin was appointed the first full-time general manager (which he held until 1981). In 1982 the society joined the Victorian Credit Co-operatives Association, the peak body for over 140 Victoria-based credit unions. In January 1986, the Canberra-based Laboratories Co-operative Credit Union Limited amalgamated with the CSIRO Co-operative Credit Society, and later that year rebranded as Sirocredit.
On 1 July 1998, Sirocredit merged with Enterprise Credit Union and Outlook Credit Union Co-operative to form Members Australia Credit Union Ltd and, in 2003, Members Australia Credit Union merged with the Education Credit Union (Ed Credit) to form the Members and Education Credit Union, styled as mecu. 
In 2011, mecu began trading as Bankmecu, Australia's first customer-owned bank and, in 2015, it commenced trading as Bank Australia.
In 2019 Bank Australia switched to purchasing 100% renewable energy from its suppliers. It was the first bank in Australia to do so.

History
Bonzun is a fem tech company that built the first symptom checker for pregnant women in the world, a virtual midwife that is recommended by both UNICEF and WHO.  Bonzun was first founded in 2010, after Bonnie Roupé got seriously ill during the pregnancy of her second child and she could not find any information online. Bonnie Roupé and her baby survived, but she could not get over the fact that so many women around the world suffer and die because of lack of information online. She wanted to create a service to make research available to doctors and mothers all over the world. Information that helps and saves lives. Bonnie Roupe stated that around 20 million women a year fall pregnant in China, meaning there was a large market for the medical information. The website describes common and serious pregnancy complications and make information accessible in China so pregnant women and health care professionals can improve their knowledge, especially in rural areas.
Bonnie Roupé is a native of Sweden, but started the company without a local partner in mainland China. In an interview, she stated that it was a good learning curve to go through the processes alone, but admitted that it may have been faster to use a local partner.
In 2012, Bonzun was selected for the Innovation Against Poverty, which was received from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

GS4,Corporate sustainable profitability,"Corporate sustainable profitability (CSP) revolves around the idea that companies who take responsibility from an economical, environmental and social perspective can become more profitable.

The stairway to CSP
Sustainable profitability can be achieved through a stairway with four steps, each step part of a value chain by production, coworkers, customers and brands. Through this process, corporates can gain a larger overall perspective on their business.
That means a new holistic approach where economic, human beings, and the environment are interrelated to make a long-term sustainable profitability. This creates an ambiance of a win-win-situation for all parts that’s involved.

Step 1 - The product
Raw material for a profitable and sustainable business.
The first step towards achieving CSP is to study and analyze the product or the service and see how it can be made more sustainable and profitable. The fundamentals of CSP entail analyzing what the product consists of: components such as working conditions, raw material and environmental impact. The study requires close collaboration with suppliers and allows companies to build a solid foundation in the effort towards a more sustainable profitability.
Environmental measures can result in savings and an increased income. (CSP). Energy efficiency, use of recycled materials, minimizing of material waste, and engaged and healthy employees are direct cost saving actions. As a business it is important to focus on the part of the product or the service process that needs attention and invest with the goal of shaping a more sustainable business.

Step 2 - The employees
The employees are the ambassadors to maintain sustainable profitability.
CSP also addresses how companies can attract motivated and engaged employees that work towards increasing business developments. Young graduates looking for jobs are now evaluating companies for both its CSR values and business environment. Therefore, it is important for companies to st"
GS4,LGBTQ-owned business,"LGBTQ-, or queer-owned businesses are businesses owned and often operated by members of the LGBTQIA+ community. They may also be described as being owned by specific subgroups, such as gay-, lesbian-, or trans-owned businesses.
Many queer-owned businesses cater specifically to marginalized people by offering products that are not otherwise widely available. They are commonly more likely to have difficulty acquiring financial backing.
Some government institutions and municipalities have special programs to support minority-owned businesses and have started to include LGBTQ-owned businesses in such programs.
In 2022, Charlie Sprinkman created the website Everywhere Is Queer to help promote queer-owned businesses around the world.

GS4,Sustainable markets,"Sustainable markets are defined as systems or institutions where the exchange of goods and services occurs with a sustainable, ethical, and environmentalist mindset. Sustainable markets differ from traditional economic markets as they aim to diminish the effects of natural resource degradation, environmental pollution, and promote safe labor practices.

Transition to sustainable markets
In order to transition to sustainable markets, the use of market governance mechanisms (MGMs) to change the behavior of economic actors has been considered. Examples of sustainable market MGMs include fair trade certifications, sustainable production reporting, carbon taxes, pollution control subsidies, and payments for ecosystem services.

History
In the past, the sustainable market discussion was limited to theories on how to best reach sustainability goals like carbon neutrality. In 2022, California governor Gavin Newsom signed The California Climate Commitment which promised to make California Carbon Neutral by 2045. Over the next two decades, the Climate Commitment aims to:

Create 4 million new jobs
Cut air pollution by 60%
Reduce state oil consumption by 91%
Save California $23 billion by avoiding the damages of pollution
Reduce fossil fuel use in buildings and transportation by 92%
Cut refinery pollution by 94%
However, much of the world has dealt with issues in implementing these goals as of 2022.

Debates
As more legislation such as the California Climate Commitment becomes commonplace, there are also questions of whether it is ethical to impose market restrictions on developing countries. Many developing countries experience greater negative impacts from climate change but are also more harshly impacted by economic restrictions. Furthermore, there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or government intervention is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets, including the use of ecotaxes.
Broader questions remain over the ability of sustainable markets to "

With headquarters in Kilifi town, the company works with thousands of farmers throughout Kilifi County, and is actively expanding into Kwale County. The company has planted over 2 million trees with over 6,000 farmers in Kenya. Komaza has goals to plant 1 billion trees with 1 million farmers across 10+ countries by 2030.

History
Komaza was founded in 2006 by Tevis Howard. Prior to starting Komaza, Howard had been pursuing a career in science from an early age. His high school science project on multiple sclerosis won Third Place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, culminating in being named on the Forbes ASAP list of ""Top-10 Teenage All Stars."" Howard then spent a gap year in Kenya, conducting malaria research at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Labs, a prominent medical research facility in Kilifi, Kenya. Howard then began his studies at Brown University, where we graduated with a degree in Neuroscience in 2007.
Howard started Komaza from his dorm room in 2005 while in his third year at college. Motivated by a desire to get rural dryland farmers out of poverty, he researched and developed several preliminary business plans, with trees emerging as the winner. Komaza started by planting a 5-acre demonstration tree farm on the Mombasa-Malindi highway on the outskirts of Kilifi town. After graduating university, Howard immediately returned to Kenya, hired an early team, and began planting with the first farmers in 2008. In that year, Howard was awarded fellowships from the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundati"

Their innovations include the Social Impact Bonds (SIB) model which has mobilised more than £500 million globally in areas such as  offender rehabilitation, children and family, homelessness and housing, young people at risk of becoming NEET, mental health and employment, loneliness and social isolation, and domestic violence.

History
Social Finance's initial team supported the work of the Commission on Unclaimed Assets, which recommended the establishment of a Social Investment Bank in March 2007 and in turn developed the blueprint for what is now named Big Society Capital. Initially financed by a group of philanthropists, later financial support included charitable trusts and foundations including: Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation and the Big Lottery Fund.
Social Finance helped develop the first Social Impact Bond project in the world in the UK in 2010, a six-year social impact bond pilot scheme run by Social Finance to see around 3,000 short-term prisoners from Peterborough prison, serving less than 12 months, receiving intensive interventions both in prison and in the community. Funding from investors outside government was initially used to pay for the services, which were delivered by Third Sector providers with a proven track record of working with offenders. If re-offending is not reduced by at least 7.5% through all tranches, the investors will receive no recompense. In August 2014, the first set of results were released, showing that the Social Impact Bond reduced reoffending by 8.4 per cent.

GS4,White Supremacy Culture,"""White Supremacy Culture"" is an influential document in the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) field. It identifies characteristics of white supremacy culture that may manifest in organizations and institutions, often unconsciously.

Author and background
The author of the piece is Tema Okun, a DEI consultant. Okun was influenced by her years of work with her mentor Kenneth Jones and wrote the piece after attending particularly inspiring anti-racism workshops in the late 1990s: ""And I came home and I sat in front of the computer. And the article literally came through me onto the computer. It was not researched. I didn’t sit down and deliberate. It just came through me."" Okun published the piece in 1999 and in 2001 included it in Dismantling Racism: A Workbook for Social Change Groups.

Contents
The piece is a bulleted list handout in which Okun identifies traits such as perfectionism, a sense of urgency, and individualism, highlighting how these cultural norms may perpetuate systemic inequality. The piece serves as a tool for reflection and discussion, encouraging organizations to examine their practices and create more inclusive environments.

Reception and influence
The document has been widely used in training and discussions around diversity, equity, and inclusion. It has been criticized for characterizing concepts such as objectivity and ""worship of the written word"" as relating to white supremacy.

The biomass cooking sector
More than 3 billion people cook using solid biomass fuels like wood, crop waste, coal and animal dung. There are also 1.2 billion people without access to electricity, who currently rely on dangerous fuels like kerosene for lighting.
The World Health Organization estimates that 4.3 million people die prematurely every year from illnesses attributable to household air pollution from burning solid fuels. These include lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, pulmonary disease and childhood pneumonia. Exposure to indoor smoke is particularly high amongst women and girls, who are typically responsible for cooking. The responsibility of sourcing fuel for cooking and heating also predominantly falls on women, who spend hours each day collecting firewood for their homes, cutting short their potential to study or do other things. 
The ACE One Energy System was designed to address these issues, while still being compatible with widely available biomass fuels, such as sticks, animal waste and agricultural waste. It is capable of burning any type of so"

GS4,Diversity (business),"Diversity, in a business context, is hiring and promoting employees from a variety of different backgrounds and identities.  Those characteristics may include various legally protected groups, such as people of different religions or races, or backgrounds that are not legally protected, such as people from different social classes or educational levels.  A business or group with people from a variety of backgrounds is called diverse; a business or group with people who are very similar to each other is not diverse.
Proponents of diversity argue that businesses benefit by having diversity in the work force. The business case for diversity stems from the progression of the models of diversity within the workplace since the 1960s. In the United States, the original model for diversity was situated around affirmative action drawing from equal employment opportunity initiatives implemented in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Equal employment opportunity was centered around the idea that any individual academically and physically qualified for a specific job could strive for (and possibly succeed) at obtaining that job without being discriminated against based on identity. These initiatives were met with accusations that tokenism, above other factors, was the reason that individuals from minority groups were being hired. Dissatisfaction from minority groups led to later diversity efforts across the workforce.
The social justice model evolved next, providing the idea that minority workers should be given disproportionately more opportunities within the workplace, a moral imperative which extends beyond the idea of equal opportunities. 
The deficit model proposes that organizations which do not have an inclusive culture will invite lower productivity, higher absenteeism, and higher turnover, which will result in higher costs to the company. Establishments with more diversity are less likely to have successful unionization attempts.

In 2016, through the company's subsidiary Kannalife, Neuropathix discovered KLS-13019 along with other therapeutic agents that prevent neuropathic pain, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce oxidative stress, and act as anti-inflammatory neuroprotectants. Both KLS-13019 and cannabidiol, prevented the development of CIPN, while only KLS-13019 uniquely reversed neuropathic pain from chemotherapy. KLS-13019 binds to fewer biological targets than cannabidiol and KLS-13019 may possess the unique ability to reverse addictive behaviour, an effect not observed with cannabidiol. Neuropathix family of monotherapeutic small molecules are focused on treating oxidative stress-related diseases, inflammation, chronic pain management and neurodegenerative disorders.
In late 2021, Neuropathix subsidiary Kannalife, was awarded a non-dilutive three-year $2.97 Million grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).

As of 2025, over 10,000 companies have set or committed to set science-based climate targets validated by SBTi.

Organization
The Science Based Targets initiative was established in 2015  to help companies to set emission reduction targets in line with climate sciences and Paris Agreement goals. It is funded by IKEA Foundation, Amazon, Bezos Earth Fund, We Mean Business coalition, Rockefeller Brothers Fund and UPS Foundation. In October 2021, SBTi developed and launched the world's first net zero standard, providing the framework and tools for companies to set science-based net zero targets and limit global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to 1.5 °C. Best practice as identified by SBTi is for companies to adopt transition plans covering scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, set out short-term milestones, ensure effective board-level governance and link executive compensation to the company's adopted milestones. SBTi is a UK charity with a commercial subsidiary, SBTi Services, which offers to validate climate targets set by companies as science-based targets for a fee. 
As of 2025, SBTi operates without a central office and has 200 staff who primarily work remotely, including part-time employees. This has led to challenges in meeting the demands of a growing client base of companies seeking SBTi validation for climate targets.

The annual results and benchmarks from GRESB's real estate and infrastructure assessments are used by fund managers to better understand their portfolio's relative performance against peers and by investors looking for standardized disclosures into a fund or firm's ESG strategies and performance. Recent scholarship suggests that over the past few years there has been significant adoption of and reporting to GRESB within the real estate industry and that GRESB participation and performance are both significant predicators of cross-sectoral fund returns. The relationship between GRESB, its foundation, and the industry representatives that sit on the foundation's board has been criticized as allowing investors too much freedom to set the standards that funds are evaluated against.

The GRESB Global Sustainable Index was launched in 2006, while the i"
GS4,Corporate political responsibility,"Corporate political responsibility (CPR) is a corporate responsibility concept that emphasizes the political dimension of a company's actions. The concept was developed in the 2010s as an enhancement of existing frameworks such as Corporate Social Responsibility. CPR regards the social and ecological aspects underlined by CSR as inherently connected to the political, thus highlighting the interdependence of business activities with the public realm, societal institutions and collective goods.
To navigate in this environment, which is also shaped by megatrends such as globalisation, digitisation and climate change, CPR proposes that companies systematically develop the political role they already have. Some authors argue that by building and managing their political brand and strengthening the political fabric in which they operate, companies can advance their economic interests. Others emphasize the need for a new norm for CPR, with companies recognizing limits on the legitimate use of their political influence. Numerous companies have begun to act in accordance with CPR principles, including the clothing manufacturers Nike and Adidas, the coffee shop chain Starbucks, the homestay marketplace Airbnb, the technology company IBM, and the watchmaker Nomos Glashütte.

Background
Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, there has been an increased awareness of companies' impact on their social and ecological environment. Under the umbrella label of corporate responsibility, several management concepts have been proposed to encourage corporations to contribute actively to the welfare of these environments. The most established of these concepts is Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Since the 2004 United Nations report Who cares wins, which popularly introduced environmental, social, and governance (ESG), sustainability principles have also found consideration in financial markets. In 2007, the political scientist David Vogel observed that many companies were "
GS4,Triple bottom line cost–benefit analysis,"Triple bottom line cost-benefit analysis (TBL-CBA) is an evidence-based economic method that combines cost–benefit analysis (CBA) and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) across the triple bottom line (TBL) to weigh costs and benefits to project stakeholders. The TBL-CBA process quantifies total net present value, return on investment, and project payback. TBL-CBA uses location-specific data to give asset owners and design professionals the flexibility and capability to provide a rigorous analysis of investment alternatives through all stages of planning and design.
Because it calculates both financial results and monetary values for social and environmental design impacts (valuing what have traditionally been considered intangible benefits such as reduced air pollution or enhanced property values), it provides a common basis for evaluating the entire impact of a project across all social, environmental or ecological, and financial factors.

Origins
TBL-CBA has its origins in cost–benefit analysis, the triple bottom line, and life-cycle cost analysis.

Cost–benefit analysis (CBA)
Cost–benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives (for example in transactions, activities, functional business requirements); it is used to determine options that provide the best approach to achieve benefits while preserving savings. It calculates the value of various impacts in dollar (or other currency) terms, making it easy to compare like-to-like.
CBA is used extensively by governments to calculate and compare benefits and costs of proposed policies, but can also be used on a design project basis to weigh different design options or justify costs of proposed designs. ""Multiple account cost–benefit analysis"" can consider the gains and losses to different stakeholders, thereby allowing the trade-offs among the project's stakeholders to be readily identified and quantified.
CBA is the primary methodology for TBL-CBA and there are m"
GS4,Liberty Kitchen,"Liberty Kitchen is a social enterprise based at HM Prison Pentonville, London. It exists to train prisoners in high-quality food preparation, and to employ ex-prisoners to sell this food at street markets. Its intention is to open up opportunities to the men, including qualifications and the possibility of self-employment, and thus reduce recidivism.
Liberty Kitchen launched in 2016. Seed funding was provided by, among others, the Royal Society of Arts and the Drapers' Company, one of the ancient livery companies of the City of London. Its board is chaired by Lord Falconer, and also includes Edward Faulks, Baron Faulks QC and the editor of Delicious, Karen Barnes. Its patrons are Iqbal Wahhab and Gina Moffat, and its founder-director is Janet Boston.
Liberty Kitchen offers prisoners a 12-week programme leading to an NVQ (National Vocational Qualification) in enterprise. The menu is centred on creative reinterpretations of meatballs, drawing on the prisoners' backgrounds for culinary ideas and London places for names. For example, the ""Ball No Chain"" range (referring to the idiom Ball and chain) includes a vegetarian ball made of broad beans, named Green Lanes after the Turkish area of North London. Liberty Kitchen was singled out for positive mention in the 2018 report of the Independent Monitoring Board, whose job it is to monitor the welfare of prisoners.
It won ""Best Streetfood/Takeaway"" at the 2019 BBC Food and Farming Awards and so was featured on BBC Radio 4 The Food Programme. In addition to street food, Liberty Kitchen caters for events; one company hired them for a staff lunch, describing this as a form of corporate social responsibility.

It was founded in 1982 as Hackney Community Transport in the London Borough of Hackney, to provide transport services for local voluntary organisations, charities, and community groups. HCT Group was registered as a company limited by guarantee (and therefore had no shareholders). The company was also a registered charity.
By 2014, HCT Group had a fleet of 500 vehicles, turnover of £43.7 million, and employed over 700. The company expanded into several areas of England and the Channel Islands through a series of acquisitions in 2017 and 2018, but after financial difficulties following the COVID-19 pandemic, the HCT Group ceased trading and entered administration in September 2022 after disposing of all its commercial bus services.

History
Hackney Community Transport was established in 1982 when 30 community groups in the London Borough of Hackney formed a pool of six vehicles with a grant from Hackney Borough Council to provide low-cost van and minibus hire for local community groups, and a door-to-door alternative to public transport for people with disabilities. The company's services were staffed by volunteers, but over the next decade a small group of paid staff built up to assist the volunteer workforce.
HCT Group received loans from London Rebuilding Society to finance its entry to the bus industry.
In 2004, HCT was contracted by EduAction to deliver 500 local special needs children to school and back each day for London Borough of Waltham Forest from a new depot in Leyton.

GS4,Stakeholder (law),"An escrow is a contractual arrangement in which a third party (the stakeholder or escrow agent) receives and disburses money or property for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties. Examples include an account established by a broker for holding funds on behalf of the broker's principal or some other person until the consummation or termination of a transaction; or, a trust account held in the borrower's name to pay obligations such as property taxes and insurance premiums. The word derives from the Old French word escroue, meaning a scrap of paper or a scroll of parchment; this indicated the deed that a third party held until a transaction was completed.

Types
Escrow generally refers to money held by a third party on behalf of transacting parties. It is mostly used regarding the purchase of shares of a company. It is best known in the United States in the context of the real estate industry (specifically in mortgages where the mortgage company establishes an escrow account to pay property tax and insurance during the term of the mortgage). Escrow is an account separate from the mortgage account where deposit of funds occurs for payment of certain conditions that apply to the mortgage, usually property taxes and insurance. The escrow agent has the duty to properly account for the escrow funds and ensure that usage of funds is explicitly for the purpose intended. Since a mortgage lender is not willing to take the risk that a homeowner may not pay property tax, escrow is usually required under the mortgage terms. 
Escrow companies are also commonly used in the transfer of high value personal and business property, like websites and businesses, and in the completion of person-to-person remote auctions (such as eBay), although the advent of new low-cost online escrow services has meant that even low-cost transactions are now starting to benefit from use of escrow.

GS4,Fossil fuel divestment,"Fossil fuel divestment or fossil fuel divestment and investment in climate solutions is an attempt to reduce climate change by exerting social, political, and economic pressure for the institutional divestment of assets including stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments connected to companies involved in extracting fossil fuels.
Fossil fuel divestment campaigns emerged on college and university campuses in the United States in 2011 with students urging their administrations to turn endowment investments in the fossil fuel industry into investments in clean energy and communities most impacted by climate change. In 2012, Unity College in Maine became the first institution of higher learning to divest its endowment from fossil fuels.
By 2015, fossil fuel divestment was reportedly the fastest growing divestment movement in history. As of July 2023, more than 1593 institutions with assets totalling more than $40.5 trillion in assets worldwide had begun or committed some form of divestment of fossil fuels.
Divesters cite several reasons for their decisions. To some, it is a means of aligning investments with core values; to others, it is a tactic for combatting the fossil fuel industry; to others, it is a way to protect portfolios from climate-related financial risk. Financial research suggests that, in the longer term, fossil fuel divestment has positively impacted investors' returns.

Motivations for divestment
Reducing carbon emissions
Fossil fuel divestment aims to reduce carbon emissions by accelerating the adoption of the renewable energy transition through the stigmatization of fossil fuel companies. This includes putting public pressure on companies that are currently involved in fossil fuel extraction to invest in renewable energy.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that all future carbon dioxide emissions must be less than 1,000 gigatonnes to provide a 66% chance of avoiding dangerous climate change; this figure includes all sources of ca"
GS4,Sustainability Accounting Standards Board,"The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a non-profit organization, founded in 2011 by Jean Rogers to develop sustainability accounting standards. Investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other providers of financial capital are increasingly attuned to the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on the financial performance of companies, driving the need for standardized reporting of ESG data. Just as the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have established International Financial Reporting Standards and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), respectively, which are currently used in the financial statements, SASB's stated mission “is to establish industry-specific disclosure standards across ESG topics that facilitate communication between companies and investors about financially material, decision-useful information. Such information should be relevant, reliable and comparable across companies on a global basis.”
SASB standards are used by companies around the world in a variety of disclosure channels, including their annual reports, financial filings, company websites, sustainability reports, and more.
In June 2021, the SASB and the London-based International Integrated Reporting Council announced their combination to form the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF). In November 2021, the IFRS Foundation announced it would consolidate the VRF and Climate Disclosure Standards Board with its own newly formed International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) by June 2022. This was completed by August 2022, when all the open SASB Standards projects were transitioned to the ISSB.

GS4,EcoProIT,"EcoProIT is a project initiated at Chalmers University of Technology at the department of Product and Production Development. The project aims to provide production engineers a tool for detailed ecological footprint analyses, which are becoming more important in terms of marketing and legislation. A published report by MIT in 2011 showed companies thought that environmental sustainable strategy is, or will be, vital to be competitive. The report included many sectors, e.g. covering medicals, automobiles and consumer products. EcoProIT will design a tool for industrial applications used for detailed environmental footprint analyses of their production systems and the products produced using simulation. The tool will simulate the production and analyze the product's environmental footprint in a standardized way. It will also be possible to use the tool for bench marking between different sites. The aim for the tool puts high requirements on standardized methods and data management.

Vision - Tool usage
The vision of the usage of EcoProIT is important. Company A, who is a big and important stakeholder, is the main user of the tool in Figure 1. They require their close supplier partner to use the same tool. Company A and supplier A and B then set up an internal connection of their tools. The connection makes the input information for Company A up to date for every use. Company A also sets up a connection to their close partners that buy or distribute Company A's products. It will then be possible to give a good estimation of the impact total specific distribution chain that will be up to data. The information can be used to inform the end users about total costs for the production data. The up to date chain gives a possibility to show the consumers that the company makes progress in lowering the environmental impact. Every improvement is delivered directly to the customers, and the new marketing possibility show what the production department is doing for the environmen"

This funding was partially matched by Arm ltd, a Cambridge based semiconductor and software company. This provided for a pilot study in partnership with BRAC and the Johns Hopkins Global mHealth Initiative to test the system with health workers in Gaibandha, Bangladesh.
In 2015, Simprints received another grant from Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board) to move prototypes to the pre-production phase and develop and verify all software. This enabled the firm to launch a pilot project with BRAC which later manifested in a formal partnership.
In 2016, Simprints developed their first production-ready biometric scanner known as Vero. It is IP65 rated and CE/FCC certified.

In October 2005, the site launched CharityVillage Campus, the first new paid service offered since its launch. Campus is a series of self-paced, web-based training courses in fundraising and nonprofit management. By that time, the website became a valuable source of career ads for the Canadian non-profit sector.
From the beginning, the site has focused on providing free resources to help nonprofit staffers and volunteers build their skills and connect with one another. Resources include original research articles and interviews, brief news items, links to nonprofits, funding sources, and other nonprofit-related resources and websites. Site users can post job, volunteer and event listings.
The site is self-sustaining through recruitment and supplier advertising revenue.
In March 2011, the website published its first Canadian Nonprofit Sector Salary Report, which went on to become an annual report.
In 2012 the website was relaunched on a new technological platform. In August 2015, Charity Village owners acquired TalentEgg.ca, a career website.

Publications
The site offers three free e-letter publications:

GS4,Sustainable finance,"Sustainable finance is the set of practices, standards, norms, regulations and products that pursue financial returns alongside environmental and/or social objectives. It is sometimes used interchangeably with Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) investing. However, many distinguish between ESG integration for better risk-adjusted returns and a broader field of sustainable finance that also includes impact investing, social finance and ethical investing. 
A key idea is that sustainable finance allows the financial system to connect with the economy and its populations by financing its agents in seeking a growth objective. The long-standing concept was promoted with the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, which stipulates that parties must make ""finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development."" In addition, sustainable finance has a key role to play in the European Green Deal and in other EU International agreements, and its popularity continues to grow in financial markets.
In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda to steer the transition towards a sustainable and inclusive economy. This commitment involves 193 member states and comprises 17 goals and 169 targets. The SDGs aim to tackle current global challenges, including protecting the planet. Sustainable finance has become a key cornerstone for the achievement of these goals.
Various government programs and incentives support green and sustainable initiatives. For instance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides grants and low-interest loans through its Clean Water State Revolving Fund for projects that improve water quality or address water infrastructure needs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) also offers loans and grants for green businesses. Research and utilize these programs to secure necessary financing.

GS4,Shared Interest,"Shared Interest Society Limited is a fair trade financial co-operative based in the United Kingdom formed in 1990. Today it provides credit and financial services to fair trade producers, retailers, importers and exporters throughout the world. Shared Interest works with both Fairtrade International (formerly known as Fairtrade Labelling Organizations or FLO) and the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO). In 2004, the Shared Interest Foundation was formed as a charitable subsidiary, providing training and support services to producers, complementing the financial services offered by the Society. Shared Interest received the Queen's Award for Enterprise in 2008.

History
The idea that led to Shared Interest was the creation of Mark Gerard Hayes, then an investment banker with 3i, now an academic economist at Cambridge University, who was the first managing director from 1990 to 1999. Inspired by the success of Traidcraft in harnessing socially responsible investment for the finance of fair trade, Hayes approached Traidcraft founder Richard Adams in 1986, beginning a collaboration that culminated in the formation of Shared Interest in 1990 as a special form of co-operative saving and loan society.
The initial £100,000 funding (subsequently repaid) for the launch of the Society came from Traidcraft, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, and a similar co-operative established in 1975 in the Netherlands, now called Oikocredit. However the creation of Shared Interest was finally made possible by the action of SIAL (Scottish Churches Action for World Development Investment Association Limited), an Oikocredit Support Association, who provided the first 200 members and £300,000 of capital in the form of shares in Oikocredit. Oikocredit was Shared Interest's main channel for lending in its first five years.
Once Shared Interest had reached a capital of £4 million (1994), a planned transition took place to establish its own lending business by the creation of a clearing house with "
GS4,Social finance,"Social finance is a category of financial services that aims to leverage private capital to address challenges in areas of social and environmental need. Having gained popularity in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, it is notable for its public benefit focus. Mechanisms of creating shared social value are not new; however, social finance is conceptually unique as an approach to solving social problems while simultaneously creating economic value. Unlike philanthropy, which has a similar mission-motive, social finance secures its own sustainability by being profitable for investors. Capital providers lend to social enterprises, who in turn, by investing borrowed funds in socially beneficial initiatives, deliver investors measurable social returns in addition to traditional financial returns on their investment.
Consensus has yet to be established on a formal definition of social finance due to a lack of clarity around its scope and intent; however, it is said to include elements of impact investing, socially responsible investing, and social enterprise lending. Investors include charitable foundations, retail investors, and institutional investors. Notable examples of social finance instruments are social impact bonds and social impact funds.
Since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the social finance industry has been experiencing a period of accelerated growth as shifts in investor sentiment have increased demand for ethically responsible investment alternatives by retail investors. Mainstream sources of capital have entered the market as a result, including Deutsche Bank, which in 2011 became the first commercial bank to raise a social investment fund.
New research in the field calls for increasing the role of government in social finance to help overcome the challenges the industry currently faces, including the struggle to produce desirable returns for investors, high start-up and regulatory costs, neglect from mainstream banks, and a lack of access "

GS4,Yunus Social Business,"Yunus Social Business (YSB) is a non-profit organisation with an impact-investing arm, Yunus Funds, and a corporate social-innovation consulting arm, Yunus Corporate Innovation. Both business units are based on furthering the concept of social business.
YSB was co-founded by Muhammad Yunus, Saskia Bruysten and Sophie Eisenmann in 2011. Its stated mission is to ""harness the power of business to end poverty and the climate crisis.""

History
Prior to co-founding Yunus Social Business, Muhammad Yunus pioneered the field of micro-finance through Grameen Bank in his home country of Bangladesh. Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize for establishing microfinance and trying to tackle poverty. Grameen Bank became the first of several social businesses that Muhammad Yunus founded.
In 2008, Muhammad Yunus and future YSB co-founder Saskia Bruysten met at the London School of Economics, where Muhammad Yunus was giving a talk on the promise of social business. Later, they exchanged contact information. This encounter led the former management consultant, Bruysten, to visit some of Muhammad Yunus' social businesses in Bangladesh. Bruysten then started setting up Grameen Creative Lab with a German entrepreneur, where her former BCG colleague Sophie Eisenmann later joined. In 2011, the trio agreed to co-found Yunus Social Business beyond Bangladesh.
YSB is active in six countries, with local offices in Brazil, Colombia, India, Kenya and Uganda.

Yunus Funds
Yunus Funds is the non-profit impact-investing arm of Yunus Social Business. It provides patient loans and post-investment support to social businesses in Brazil, Colombia, India, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.

GS4,Fourth bottom line,"Fourth bottom line is a concept extended from the triple bottom line; instead of simply focusing on the 3 Ps: people, planet and profit, this concept involves extending to a fourth factor which not only has motivation for a business but also transcends to a humanistic value and beyond by factoring in terms such as ""spirituality"", ""ethics"", ""purpose"", ""culture"", ""compassion"".

Background
In traditional business accounting and common usage, the ""bottom line"" refers to either the ""profit"" or ""loss"", which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and ""social justice"" advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing full cost accounting. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal cost benefit analysis? The triple bottom line adds two more ""bottom lines”: social and environmental (ecological) concerns. With the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting.  Similar UN standards apply to natural capital and human capital measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting ecological footprint. The TBL seems to be fairly widespread in South African media, as found in a 1990-2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.

GS4,Values-based innovation,"Values-based innovation is a theoretical concept and managerial approach that “understands and applies individual, organisational, societal, and global values, and corresponding normative orientations as a basis for innovation”. It demonstrates the potential of values to integrate diverse stakeholders into innovation processes, to direct collaborative efforts, and to generate innovations with a positive impact on societal challenges. It elaborates upon the interrelations between innovation management, an established management practice and field of research, and values-based management, which is generally dealt with in business ethics and focuses on the ethical concerns related to corporate management.

History of origin
Human values are considered as having a profound impact on every level of social life: individual, organizational, institutional, societal, and global. As such they provide valuable points of reference for understanding corporate stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, customers, partners, etc., and catering to their needs through innovation. For instance, changing stakeholder values as well as new public policies and normative frameworks, such as the European Green Deal or UN's Sustainable Development Goals, have created new challenges and opportunities for sustainability-oriented innovation. There are several innovation discourses that have emerged in response to these new challenges, such as on responsible innovation, social and sustainable innovation. By reflecting upon normative statements and considering stakeholder values (rather than just short-lived interests), these new streams have taken the first steps to explore the relationships between particular values, such as pro-environmental values, intergenerational justice and equity, values of sustainability-oriented business, protection of privacy, or safety. In parallel to them the values-based view on innovation has emerged on the grounds of a broader perspective, non-prescriptive wi"
GS4,TechMission,"TechMission is a Christian non-profit organization focused on online education. Its current focus is training nonprofit leaders in ministry management and addiction counseling through its accredited online college, City Vision University.

History and former programs
TechMission was founded in 2000 as an extension of the ministry of the PREP Computer Center, a Dorchester-based computer center run as a partnership between Bruce Wall Ministries and two local churches. Andrew Sears, who was then executive director of PREP, and other leaders of Christian community computer centers created TechMission's AC4 program (the Association of Christian Community Computer Centers) to connect and provide resources to similar computer centers. At its peak, it served over 500 centers, including ones affiliated with the Salvation Army, Christian Community Development Association, and the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions.
TechMission became a separate non-profit entity in 2002. Over the next several years it developed the TechMission Corps internships program to provide full-time workers to serve in after-school, teen, and adult technology education programs, as well as providing the curriculum and software benefits of AC4 membership. It sent out interns to organizations in Boston, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and Western Massachusetts. For several years it received AmeriCorps funding. Later, it was associated with TechMission's online university, City Vision University.
In 2005, TechMission started its Safe Families Program, which promotes online safety through providing free training and web-filtering software. The TechMission Volunteer Network (ChristianVolunteering.org) was launched the following year. In 2007, TechMission launched UrbanMinistry.org, which used Web 2.0 technologies, such as user-submitted content to further promote collaboration and resource-sharing between Christian community development ministries.

GS4,Twitch (service),"Twitch is an American video live-streaming service popular in video games, including broadcasts of esports competitions. It also offers music broadcasts, creative content, and ""in real life"" streams. Twitch is operated by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of Amazon. It was introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform Justin.tv. 
Content on the site can be viewed either live or via video on demand. The games shown on Twitch's current homepage are listed according to audience preference and include genres such as real-time strategy games, fighting games, racing games, and first-person shooters.
The popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of Justin.tv. In October 2013, the website had 45 million unique viewers, and by February 2014, it was considered the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Twitch Interactive to represent the shift in focus when Justin.tv was getting shut down in August 2014. The same month, the service was acquired by Amazon for US$970 million, which later led to the introduction of synergies with the company's subscription service Amazon Prime.
By 2015, Twitch had more than 100 million viewers per month. In 2017, Twitch remained the leading live-streaming video service for video games in the US, and had an advantage over YouTube Gaming, which shut down its standalone app in May 2019. As of February 2020, it had three million broadcasters monthly and 15 million active users daily, with 1.4 million average concurrent users. As of May 2018, Twitch had over 27,000 partner channels. As of January 2025, Twitch was the 30th-most-visited website in the world with 23.46% of its traffic coming from the United States, followed by Russia with 8.87%, Germany with 7.08% and France with 6.26%. In late 2023, Twitch announced that they would stop operating in South Korea in 2024 because of its network fee policy, citing prohibitive costs.

GS4,Sustainable products,"Sustainable products are products either sustainably sourced, manufactured or processed and provide environmental, social, and economic benefits while protecting public health and the environment throughout their whole life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to the final disposal.

Scope of definition
According to Belz, Frank-Martin, the definition of sustainable product has six characteristics:

Customer satisfaction: any products or services that do not meet customer needs will not survive in the market in the long term.
Dual focus: Unlike purely environmental products, sustainable products focus on ecological and social significance.
Life-cycle orientation: Sustainable products are environmentally friendly throughout their life. That is, from the moment the raw materials are extracted to the moment the final product is disposed of, there must be no permanent environmental damage.
Significant improvements: Sustainable products contribute to solving socio-ecological problems globally or provide measurable improvements in socio-ecological product performance.
Continuous improvement: as the state of knowledge, technologies, and societal expectations continually develop, sustainable products should also continuously improve social and environmental variation.
Competing offers: sustainable products may still lag behind competing offers, therefore, the competing offers may serve as a benchmark regarding social and ecological performance.
Michael Braungart and William McDonough's book Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things  expands on the life-cycle part of this definition. They suggest that every material and product should be made in a manner that when its useful life is over, all the materials of which it is made can be returned to the Earth after composting, or endlessly recycled as raw materials.

GS4,Refurbishment (electronics),"In electronics, refurbishment is the practice of restoring and testing a pre-owned electronic device so that it can be re-sold. Refurbished electronics are therefore pre-owned electronic devices (usually smartphones, tablets, or laptops), that have been tested by a reseller to confirm that they are fully working. Other refurbished electronics include smartwatches, games consoles, and cameras.
Usually, a refurbished electronic device is one that has been previously returned or re-sold to a retailer for any reason. They are then tested, and if necessary,  repaired by a specialist refurbisher (or sometimes by the original manufacturer). Refurbished electronics may also be referred to as renewed, reconditioned, recycled, recertified, or ""like new"" electronics.

Competing Definitions
In many countries, the word ""refurbished"" is not legally protected (although France has introduced a legal definition as of 2022). This means that different electronics resellers will have different definitions of what counts as a refurbished device. In theory, a smartphone could be sold as 'refurbished' with no repairs or testing whatsoever. However, most refurbished devices have been rigorously tested to ensure they are fully working.

Used vs. Refurbished
In the UK, the refurbished electronics marketplace Back Market claims that ""refurbished"" devices are distinct from ""used"" devices, where a ""used"" device is one where no repairs or testing have taken place. However other specialist retailers, like The Big Phone Store, define refurbished phones as a specific type of used or second-hand device.

Apple Certified Refurbished
Devices sold as 'Certified Refurbished' through the Apple store differ from most other refurbished devices. For example, iOS devices sold as Apple Certified Refurbished will always come with a brand-new battery and brand-new ""outer shell"". Because of this, these devices may be considered remanufactured, rather than refurbished.

Education
The US SIF Foundation's Center for Sustainable Investment Education provides education, research and thought leadership on sustainable investment to investors, investment advisors, consultants and analysts.

Public policy
The US SIF Public Policy Program supports an agenda that advances sustainable investment to the national legislative and executive branches of government. Through US SIF, the sustainable investment industry brings a distinct voice and set of priorities to legislative and regulatory initiatives. Establishing standards for reporting and ESG analysis will likely need regulatory changes.
In an effort to counter pushback against ESG investing by Republican policy makers in 2022, US SIF published a detailed response to those attacks.

Events
US SIF has organized an annual conference since 2011. Conferences are focused on a broad range of environmental, social and governance issues, centered on substantive sessions and networking opportunities.

GS4,360 Agency Berlin Sustainable advertising,"Sustainable advertising addresses the carbon footprint and other negative environmental and social impacts associated with the production and distribution of advertising materials. A growing number of companies are making a commitment to the reduction of their environmental impact associated with advertising production and distribution.

Advertising's environmental impact
Print advertising impacts the environment due to the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere as a result of the production and distribution of print media. Factors include the sourcing and production of paper, petroleum-based ink, solvents, plastics and adhesives used and the fossil fuels burned in the manufacturing and distribution of newspapers and magazines. Digital media has impacts due to the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacturing and operation of servers and datacenter devices, networking devices and client computers as well as the e-waste impacts of these devices at the end of their useful lives.
In 2004, over 7 billion metrics tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases associated with print media advertising were emitted into the atmosphere by the United States.
In 2005 U.S. advertisers spent over $65 billion on print media advertising and created over 250,000 ad pages. A single ad page run in a popular consumer magazine can represent as much as seven tons of carbon dioxide emissions when supply chain factors associated with papermaking, printing, logistics and landfill disposal or incineration of post-consumer and unsold media are taken into consideration. 
According to a recent New York Times article quoting David J. Refkin, director of sustainable development for Time Inc., a single copy of Time magazine results in the emission of .29 pounds of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses.

GS4,Social business,"Social business was defined by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus and is described in his books. 
In these books, Yunus defined a social business as a business:

Created and designed to address a social problem
A non-loss, non-dividend company, i.e.
It is financially self-sustainable and
Profits realized by the business are reinvested in the business itself (or used to start other social businesses), with the aim of increasing social impact, for example expanding the company’s reach, improving the products or services or in other ways subsidizing the social mission.
Unlike a profit-maximizing business, the prime aim of a social business is not to maximize profits (although generating profits is desired). Furthermore, business owners are not receiving any dividend out of the business profits, if any.
On the other hand, unlike a non-profit, a social business is not dependent on donations or on private or public grants to survive and to operate, because, as any other business, it is self-sustainable. Furthermore, unlike a non-profit, where funds are spent only once on the field, funds in a social business are invested to increase and improve the business's operations on the field on an indefinite basis. Per Yunus: ""A charity dollar has only one life; a social business dollar can be invested over and over again.""
Philosophically, social business is based on what Yunus identifies as the two basic motives of human beings, selfishness and selflessness. Selfishly, people do seek profit through business; however, social business is also based on the latter motive people by performing philanthropic services, like establishing churches, mosques, synagogues, art museums, public parks, health clinics or community centers. For Yunus, the profits made through a social business's operations are less important than the beneficial effects it has on society.

GS4,Sullivan principles,"The Sullivan principles are the names of two corporate codes of conduct, developed by the African-American preacher Rev. Leon Sullivan, promoting corporate social responsibility:

The original Sullivan principles were developed in 1977 to apply economic pressure on South Africa in protest of its system of apartheid. The principles eventually gained wide adoption among United States–based corporations.
For more, see #The Sullivan principles below.
The new global Sullivan principles were jointly unveiled in 1999 by Rev. Sullivan and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. The new and expanded corporate code of conduct, as opposed to the originals' specific focus on South African apartheid, were designed to increase the active participation of corporations in the advancement of human rights and social justice at the international level.

The Sullivan principles
In 1977, Rev. Leon Sullivan, an African-American minister, was a member of the board of General Motors. At the time, General Motors was one of the largest corporations in the United States. General Motors also happened to be the largest employer of black people in South Africa, a country which was pursuing a harsh program of state-sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination targeted primarily at the country's black population.
Sullivan, looking back on his anti-Apartheid efforts, recalled:

Starting with the work place, I tightened the screws step by step and raised the bar step by step. Eventually I got to the point where I said that companies must practice corporate civil disobedience against the laws and I threatened South Africa and said in two years Mandela must be freed, apartheid must end, and blacks must vote or else I'll bring every American company I can out of South Africa.

The original principles

GS4,Social earnings ratio,"The social earnings ratio, sometimes abbreviated to S/E, is a single-number metric, used to measure the social impact of various organisations. The non-financial metric is similar to the price earnings ratio, but instead focuses on valuation against social impact, rather than projected earnings.
The ratio was founded in 2011 by Olinga Ta'eed and a team of financial experts, in order to find a way of measuring financial investment against real social impact. It began as a university collaboration in the United Kingdom, before becoming an internationally recognized form of measurement, when the CCEG was founded.
In 2013, it was identified in a news article as ""the most rapidly adopted metric in the world"".

History
The Social Earnings Ratio (S/E) is a form of measuring sentiment and converting it into financial value. The ratio began as an idea to develop a single number metric to measure social value. In November 2011, a university collaboration was formed to manage this development. Around 18 months later, the Centre for Citizenship, Enterprise and Governance (CCEG) was formed in April 2013, to act as the standards body to curate the ratio globally. The standards body would also be run as a non-profit. The Board for the CCEG was to include Professor Nick Petford, who was also the Vice-Chancellor at the University of Northampton.
Following the establishment of the CCEG, Olinga Ta'eed was the keynote speaker at the Global Citizen Forum.

Covalence “Best EthicalQuote Score” established the amount of published positive minus negative news since 2002.

GS4,Social accounting,"Social accounting (also known as social accounting and auditing, social accountability, social and environmental accounting, corporate social reporting, corporate social responsibility reporting, non-financial reporting or accounting) is the process of communicating the social and environmental effects of organizations' economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large. Social Accounting is different from public interest accounting as well as from  critical accounting.
Social accounting is commonly used in the context of business, or corporate social responsibility (CSR), although any organisation, including NGOs, charities, and government agencies may engage in social accounting. Social Accounting can also be used in conjunction with community-based monitoring (CBM).

It is an important step in helping companies independently develop CSR programs which are shown to be much more effective than government mandated CSR.
Social accounting is a broad field that can be divided into narrower fields. Environmental accounting may account for an organisation's impact on the natural environment. Sustainability accounting is the quantitative analysis of social and economic sustainability. National accounting uses economics as a method of analysis. The International Standards Organization (ISO) provides a standard, ISO 26000, which is a resource for social accounting. It addresses the seven core areas to be assessed for social responsibility accounting.
